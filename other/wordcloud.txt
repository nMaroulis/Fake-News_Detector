The combination “trusted source” “repetition” inserts belief minds , there, may difficult dislodge — unless exposed trusted source plus repetition. As know, consuming saturated fat cholesterol increases risk heart disease, sugar not. You heard many trusted sources repeated endlessly forms communication. ScienceNews Magazine, October 15, 2016, Sugar industry sought sugarcoat causes heart disease Payments revealed authors influential 1967 report touting fat cholesterol problems, LAURA BEIL Using records unearthed library storage vaults, researchers recently revealed sugar industry paid nutrition experts Harvard University downplay studies linking sugar heart disease. Although incident happened 1960s, appears helped redirect scientific narrative decades. Harvard University — could trusted source Harvard University? Note however, Harvard University conduct research, Harvard University verify findings research. Research done people, employees Harvard , employees Harvard gives researchers special insight virtue. Yet mere association name “Harvard,” implies intelligence academic trustworthiness. The documents show Sugar Research Foundation paid professors wrote two-part review 1967 New England Journal Medicine . That report highly skeptical evidence linking sugar cardiovascular problems accepting role fat. The now-deceased professors’ overall conclusion left “no doubt” reducing risk heart disease matter reducing saturated fat cholesterol, according researchers University California, San Francisco, published report online September 12 JAMA Internal Medicine . Now, University California, San Francisco, another trusted source, impugning trusted Harvard results. The sugar industry helped deflect way research developing,” says study coauthor Cristin Kearns, dentist UCSF’s Institute Health Policy Studies. The belief sugar’s innocence, sugar industry’s profit motive, powerful, took dentist, cardiologist uncover apparently biased results ostensibly heart study. Following publication Harvard report, fat cholesterol went hijack scientific agenda decades, even led craze low-fat foods often added sugar. It 2015 dietary guidelines finally made strong statement limit sugar. Researchers writing year Progress Cardiovascular Diseases note current studies estimate diets high added sugars carry three times higher risk death cardiovascular disease. ( The Sugar Association says statement website “ last several decades research concluded sugar unique role heart disease. ” ) Is example deception true statement ? Yes, unfortunately, last several decades research absolve sugar blame, “unique role heart disease” really mean? If sugar causes heart disease, “unique role”? The Sugar Association’s statement acknowledged secret deal occurred, pointed “when studies question published, funding disclosures transparency standards norm today.” Translation: The research lied, back then, didn’t reveal lie. So, it’s O.K. Journals require authors list conflicts interest, especially funding source vested interest outcome. While modern researcher could take corporate money, even speaking fees, without disclosure, influences may subtle, says. “We’re talking making data, perhaps influencing research question framed.” Revealing source funding doesn’t eliminate bias. And, though one reasonably may conclude high percentage private funding comes sources ax grind, doesn’t necessarily mean research results misleading. But, funding leads question: “What happens results disagree benefactor’s purpose? If several, slightly different pieces research show sugar adverse effect heart health, one shows doesn’t, happens negative research? Andy Bellatti, cofounder strategic director Dietitians Professional Integrity says researchers don’t necessarily want cozy industry, sometimes turn commercial sources non-biased research money lacking . “The reason food industry able little public funding nutrition disease.” Here yet another example, among hundreds, cuts federal deficit spending hurt America , though often benefitting big business. And need organization titled, “ Dietitians Professional Integrity” tell today’s food research? The scientific community reject industry money wholesale, says John Sievenpiper, physician nutrition researcher University Toronto. He believes scientist takes industry money adhere even higher standard openness, including releasing study protocols ahead time reviewers make sure research question changed midstream favor certain conclusion. Bottom line: For many years, belief “benign sugar” created “trusted sources” repetition. As privately owned banks , profit motive encourages unethical behavior. Corporations fund research generosity. They consider research part marketing efforts. Negative results often twisted hidden. Researchers, whether employed Harvard University, University California, private organization, working alone, swayed , consciously not, tilt interpretations favor money supply. Cuts federally funded Research & Development grants misguided primary purpose “save federal government money” “make government smaller” (a huge, often unacknowledged disadvantage libertarianism). While federal government political motives, profit motive , alone helps make trusted source food & drug research private industry.

Unfortunately, GOP’s short-term win backfired long-term consequences: 35-year consent decree puts strong limits “poll watching” activities. These legal restrictions don’t expire next year. Naturally, Donald Trump’s renewed call “poll watchers” triggered concerns part DNC lawyers national level. Now, they’re demanding courts extend consent decree 2025.

They’re helping “monitor” polling places since — thanks SCOTUS — longer many actual monitors U.S. elections. But, POLITICO points out, there’s huge difference impartial observers around provide advice support voters poll workers “poll watchers” spreading misinformation scaring voters. ‘Trump seems advocating type election monitoring relies volunteers use deceptive practices often used prevent people color voting. Voter suppression changed since era literacy tests poll taxes. In 2016, suppression occurs two distinct stages: one election, one polling locations themselves.’ The POLITICO article explains GOP tries scare people voting two stages. Stage 1: Before election, Republicans try keep people casting ballots false — sometimes scary — information. In 2008, mailers went telling Democratic voters Virginia Election Day moved Tuesday Wednesday. Meanwhile, black neighborhoods Milwaukee (2004) Philadelphia (2008) got plastered flyers warning people unpaid child support parking tickets might get arrested show vote. Stage 2: On election day, so-called “poll watchers” — often fake badges IDs make look like they’re positions authority — single non-white voters demands ID questions citizenship. They also often scare eligible voters taking photos video footage (which sounds innocuous unless happen among roughly 7.5 million people stalked year). And, let’s forget — here’s “poll watchers” looked like post-Civil War Reconstruction era.0 122 WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange’s lawyers suggested globally detested, thorn side social figure keep at, even perhaps intensify, efforts fully pardoned United States President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year.

As scandal-weary voters threatened serious cerebral overload, continuing array titillating revelations spanned naming MSM names collusion Democrats otherwise obscure reporter suggesting Podesta link Russia Trump multitude documents identifying Clinton Foundation vehicle nefarious dealings – host unethical examples steal democracy, rank-and-file continues look way, clinging illusion Democrats good guys, white hats social change. Beginning DNC scandal July revealed host pre-meditated efforts undermine Bernie Sanders campaign steal nomination, question remains whether candidate nominated result flawed, legally flawed, Democratic primary process could considered politically legitimate candidate general election office US President. The Clinton campaign apparently never felt need resolve question. Since Wikileaks emails total surprise, would appear real October Surprise FBI Director James B. Comey’s dramatic turn-around announcement October 28th Clinton email investigation re-opened due new information result investigation Carlos Danger. Comey, reportedly privately criticized disgruntled agents department dismissal felony charges Clinton, informed pertinent Congressional Committee Chairs ranking Democrats renewed investigation unusual letter Friday. Acknowledging agency previously “completed investigation,” Comey said “due recent developments” FBI “learned existence emails appear pertinent investigation.” Comey continued briefed FBI’s investigative team, “agreed FBI take proper investigative steps” “determine whether (the emails) contain classified information .” To put current crisis context, several days FBI’s original announcement July, Rep. Curt Gowdy’s (R-SC) conducted vigorous cross examination Comey devastating FBI’s “no charge” determination proof intent determination was, turn, irreparably damaging Secretary Clinton’s credibility. In words, backed corner Gowdy, Comey confirmed Clinton misrepresented facts. Comey’s responses front page headlines received barely ripple MSM Wikileaks confirmed takes marching orders DNC. In response newest FBI investigation surfaced Friday, Secretary Clinton demanded , contrary standard procedure, FBI “release information has” “needs share whatever facts American people” “it deeply troubling voters deserve get full complete facts” without recognition irony. Secretary Clinton is, course, subject interest renewed investigation understands purpose reopened investigation ferret facts. Rather shoot hip conform candidate Clinton’s demands, Comey responsibility conduct thorough investigation free political intimidation occurred July. While public speculate real backstory, one, prompting FBI initiate current investigation, surely Comey understands line here. For FBI come back future time another ‘no charges’ determination, everyone go home folks, there’s nothing see, would irredeemably irretrievably doom FBI, already thin ice, drive once-Constitutional democracy ditch. As Democrats continue circle wagons, counting mindless Democrat continue nonsensical anti-Russian agenda, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Oh) stepped forward link FBI Putin true source new stash emails found home computer former Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-NY), estranged husband HRC’s long-time confidante Huma Abedin. FBI officials first estimated ‘ tens thousands emails’ belonging Ms. Abedin since revised estimate 650,000 emails may include missing 33,000 emails previously erased may sent Secretary Clinton’s private email server. Following thread, assume percentage Ms. Abedin’s emails ‘classified’ ‘top secret’ (which reasonable assumption) husband, repeatedly exhibited gross lapses judgment, free open access computer, question terrifies Democrats knowing content Abedin emails contained Weiner’s laptop. As throw oil bonfire, reported weekend Comey’s decision reopen Clinton investigation done Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s recommendation. You may recall July, Lynch participated highly controversial tarmac meeting former President Bill Clinton – days prior Comey’s announcement would criminal charges Hilary Clinton. Looking back July announcement may factor Comey’s role current controversy. It is, course, FBI Director’s job conduct investigation Attorney General’s decision whether pursue prosecution. Given Lynch – Clinton tarmac meeting widely publicized, good guess political players decided appropriate Comey ‘no charges’ announcement rather Lynch – already publicly castigated favoring Clinton meeting Big Bill. Lynch took easy way Comey sent face public ire take heat. According Jane Mayer The New Yorker , Lynch opposed Comey’s letter Congress opposed following DOJ practice comment involvement regarding political campaign could interpreted attempting ‘influence’ campaign – become frequent refrain season Clinton campaign continues flail frantic desperation, willingness discredit anyone whose presence threatens path White House – Russian President Vladimir Putin, Republican candidate Donald Trump, Wikileaks’ Julian Assange FBI Director James Comey. Against background, Friday Comey position sitting potentially explosive new information taking risk would publicly slammed favoring Clinton attempting influence election. According Mayer’s sources, Comey felt ‘compelled’ go forward letter reopen Clinton case DOJ recommendation. The Democratic Coalition Against Trump (DCAT) filed formal Complaint Department Justice, Office Professional Responsibility Comey ‘interfering Presidential election” citing Hatch Act prohibits federal employees participating politically partisan acts. In imprudent display anguish Clinton campaign, Scott Dworkin, senior advisor DCAT, said “it absolutely absurd FBI Director Comey would support Trump like eleven days go election.” And anticipating special entitlement candidate, Dworkin continued “Comey needs focus stopping terrorists protecting America, investigating soon President Elect Hillary Clinton.” Immediately July announcement Clinton drew Home Free card, Comey object much Democratic adulation praise exemplary record trustworthiness. However, weekend, Clinton campaign launched ferocious attack giving media benefactors Democratic bigwigs green light dump Comey arsenal steamrollers. In keeping Democratic strategy irrational verbal assaults, Senator Harry Reid (D-Nv) wrote asserting Comey’s violation Hatch Act “bars FBI officials using official authority influence election” former DNC Chair Howard Dean declared “Comey put side Putin.” While US law bans foreign government interference elections, outrage Israel’s heavy hand manipulation American electoral policy decisions last twenty years?

SubscribeHome / News / Hillary Insisted America Fact Check Her, So We Did…Here’s 6 Huge Lies From The Debate Hillary Insisted America Fact Check Her, So We Did…Here’s 6 Huge Lies From The Debate fisher 4 mins ago News Comments Off Hillary Insisted America Fact Check Her, So We Did…Here’s 6 Huge Lies From The Debate Hillary Insisted America Fact Check Her, So We Did…Here’s 6 Huge Lies From The Debate Hillary Clinton stood millions Americans last night told numerous lies, said things like “Google it”, suggesting fact check her…so found 6 major lies, plus others. FACT CHECK #1 – Hillary Clinton claimed Planned Parenthood “provides cancer screenings” therefore de-funded, spite controversy abortion. Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE This repeated claim deployed defense Planned Parenthood, true, least regards breast cancer. As left-leaning Washington Post ’s fact-checker wrote 2015: When Democratic lawmakers supporters assert Planned Parenthood “provides” mammograms, highly misleading language could interpreted mean group directly administers X-rays. The group “provide” mammograms. Rather, situation similar clinics patients referred licensed facility provide biopsies, X-rays specialized services. It slightly accurate say women “access” mammograms via Planned Parenthood, though it’s still slippery language. FACT CHECK #2 – Hillary Clinton responded question Supreme Court gun rights saying, “I support Second Amendment.” Fact-Check: FALSE When Clinton made statement responding question District Columbia v. Heller (2008) decision: decision dealing foundations Second Amendment; roots protects. In Heller ruling, SCOTUS reaffirmed Second Amendment protects individual right keep bear arms. This decision become bulwark leftists spent decades academia, politics journalism trying persuade Americans Second Amendment protects collective right. (If collective, left could tie gun ownership service militia bar gun ownership anyone save serve militia today’s military police forces.) So Heller crucial. In fact, crucial stretch say entire Second Amendment rests it. Yet Hillary disagrees Heller ruling. Her spokesman Josh Schwerin said Hillary believes Heller “ wrongly decided .” So woman believe “individual” right keep bear arms support Second Amendment? She can’t. Incidentally, Clinton made point evident debate said disagreement Heller decision way SCOTUS applied Second Amendment case. For may know, Heller centered Washington DC’s gun ban–which subsequently struck via SCOTUS decision. To oppose application Second Amendment Heller oppose fact gun ban overturned. That supporting Second Amendment. FACT CHECK #3 – Hillary Clinton said third presidential debate Las Vegas Wednesday “will add penny debt” elected president. Fact-Check: FALSE Indeed, Hillary Clinton’s claim even close true. The Committee Responsible Federal Budget predicts Clinton’s policies , debt would increase $9 trillion decade. “Clinton’s plan would increase spending revenue,” Washington, D.C.-based independent non-profit’s analyst said . “Under preliminary updated central estimate, would increase primary spending $1.65 trillion next decade, including $500 billion spending college education, $300 billion paid family leave infrastructure, significant new health-related spending.” FACT CHECK #4 – Hillary Clinton claimed “33,000 people year…die guns.” Fact-Check: FALSE This claim Clinton often makes make gun violence appear raging control; justify government stepping rules regulations keep American people safe. However, Fact-Check shows Clinton’s claim false, exaggerated 66 percent. She using figures 2013, reporting way distorts really happened guns year. Clinton first began making claim November 2015, repeated April 2016, since repeated again. In April Breitbart News highlighted method Clinton used swell numbers: In 2013, Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) reported 11,208 firearm-related homicides United States. An additional 505 accidental firearm-related deaths occurred US–a figure pales comparison 38,851 deaths accidental poisoning 30,208 deaths caused falls.

By Thierry Meyssan Observing US presidential electoral campaign, Thierry Meyssan analyses resurgence old weighty conflict civilisation. Hillary Clinton declared election programmes, question ŤWho Americans?ť. It reasons political prgramme Republican leaders withdrawn support candidate, Donald Trump, personal behaviour. According Thierry Meyssan, now, United States composed migrants different horizons accepted submit ideology particular community . This model process breaking down, risk shattering country itself. " Voltaire " - During year US electoral campaign weathered, rhetoric profoundly changed, unexpected rift appeared two camps. If, beginning, candidates spoke subjects genuinely political (such sharing wealth national security), today mostly talking sex money. It dialogue, political questions, caused explosion Republican party  whose main leaders withdrawn support candidate - recomposing political chess-board, awakening ancient cleavage civilisation. On one side, Mrs. Clinton working appear politically correct, other, ŤThe Donaldť blowing hypocrisy ex-ŤFirst Ladyť smithereens. On one side, Hillary Clinton promises male / female equality - although never hesitated attack defile women revealed slept husband  presenting personal qualities, wife ex-President, accuses Donald Trump misogyny hide appreciation female gender. On other, Donald Trump denounces privatisation State racketing foreign personalities Clinton Foundation obtain appointments State Department  creation ObamaCare interest citizens, profit medical insurance companies - goes far question honesty electoral system. I perfectly aware way Donald Trump expresses may encourage racism, I believe second question heart electoral debate, despite hype pro-Clinton medias. It without interest that, Lewinsky affair, President Bill Clinton apologised Nation convened number preachers pray salvation. But accused similar misconduct audio recording, Donald Trump simply apologised people upset without making appeal members clergy. The currrent divide re-awakens revolt Catholic, Orthodox Lutheran values Calvinists, mainly represented USA Presbyterians, Baptists Methodists. While two candidates raised Puritan tradition (Clinton Methodist Trump Presbyterian), Mrs. Clinton returned religion father, participates today prayer group composed army chiefs staff, The Family, Mr. Trump practises interior form spirituality rarely goes church. Of course, no-one locked systems raised, people act without thinking, unconsciously reproduce systems. The question religious environment candidates may therefore important. In order understand stakes game, go back look 17th century England. Oliver Cromwell instigated military coup detat overthrew King Charles 1st. He wanted install Republic, purify soul country, ordered decapitation ex-sovereign. He created sectarian régime inspired ideas Calvin, massacred thousands Irish Papists, imposed Puritan way life. He also created Zionism  invited Jews back England, first head state world demand creation Jewish state Palestine. This bloody episode known name ŤFirst British Civil Warť. After monarchy reinstated, Cromwells Puritans fled England. They set Holland, left Americas aboard Mayflower (the ŤPilgrim Fathersť), others founded Afrikaneer community South Africa. During War Independence 18th century United States, saw resurgence struggle Calvinists British monarchy, current manuals British History, known ŤSecond Civil Warť. In 19th century, American Civil War opposed Southern States (mainly inhabited Catholic colonists) North (mostly inhabited Protestant colonists). The History winning side presents confrontation fight freedom face slavery, pure propaganda. The Southern states abolished slavery war concluded agreement British monarchy). As result, saw revolt Puritans Brititsh throne, historians speak ŤThird British Civil Warť. During 20th century, interior confrontation British civilisation seemed done with, apart re-appearance Puritans United Kingdom Ťnon-conformist Christiansť Prime Minister David Lloyd George. It divided Ireland agreed create Ť Jewish national homelandť Palestine. In case, one Richard Nixons advisors, Kevin Philipps, dedicated voluminous thesis civil wars, noted none problems solved, announced fourth confrontation [ 1 ]. I doubt Mrs. Clinton next President United States, Mr. Trump elected, would rapidly eliminated. But last months, witnessed large electoral redistribution within irreversible demographic evolution. The Puritan-based churches account quarter population, swinging towards Democrat camp. Their model looks like historical accident. It disappeared South Africa, able survive much longer, either United States Israël. Beyond Presidential election, US society evolve rapidly split again. In country youth massively rejects influence Puritan preachers, longer possible displace question equality. The Puritans envisage society men equal, equivalent. Lord Cromwell wanted Republic English, massacred Irish Papists. This moment United States  citizens equal law, name texts, black people systematically condemned, attenuating circumstances found white people committed equivalent crimes. And majority states, penal condemnation, even speeding ticket, enough cancel right vote. Consequently, white black people equal, states, majority black people legally deprived right vote. The paradigm thought, terms foreign policy, Ťtwo-stateť solution Palestine  equal, all, equivalent. It Puritan thinking led administrations preacher Carter, Reagan, Bush (Sr. Jr. direct descendants Pilgrim Fathers), Clinton Obama support Wahhabism, contradiction declared ideals countries, today, support Daesh. A long time ago, Founding Fathers built communities Plymouth Boston idealised US collective memory. And yet historians formal  claimed creating ŤNew Israëlť, chose ŤLaw Mosesť. They place Cross temples, Tables Law. Although Christians, attach importance Jewish scriptures Gospel. They oblige women veil faces re-established corporaI punishment.

First come casualties: around 10,000, almost 4,000 civilians. Then come anonymous British American advisers seem quite content go helping Saudi onslaughts funerals, markets obviously (to Brits, I suppose) military targets. Then come Saudi costs: $250m (Ł200m) month, according Standard Chartered Bank  country cannot pay debts construction companies. But comes dark comedy bit: Saudis included bombing targets cows, farms sorghum  used bread animal fodder  well numerous agricultural facilities. In fact, substantial evidence emerging Saudis coalition allies  and, I suppose, horrid British advisers  deliberately targeting Yemens tiny agricultural sector campaign which, successful, would lead post-war Yemeni nation starvation total reliance food imports survival. Much would doubt come Gulf states currently bombing poor country bits. Mundy points conservative report ministry agriculture irrigation Yemeni capital Sanaa, gathered officers across country , details 357 bombing targets countrys 20 provinces, including farms, animals, water infrastructure, food stores, agricultural banks, markets food trucks. These include destruction farms Yasnim, Baqim district Saadah province Marran. Mundy compared attacks figures Yemen Data Project, published weeks ago. Her verdict unhappy one. According Food Agriculture Organisation, 2.8 per cent Yemens land cultivated, Mundy says. To hit small amount agricultural land, target it. Saudi Arabia already accused war crimes, striking agriculture fields food products Yemen crude way adds merely another grim broken promise Saudis. The kingdom signed additional protocol August 1949 Geneva Conventions specifically states it prohibited attack, destroy, remove render useless objects indispensable survival civilian population, foodstuffs, agricultural areas production foodstuffs, crops, livestock specific purpose denying sustenance value civilian population whatever motive  The fact Yemen long part Saudi Arabias proxy war Shiites especially Iran  accused, without evidence, furnishing weapons Shia Houthi Yemen  meekly accepted part Middle Easts current sectarian narrative (like good rebels eastern Aleppo very bad rebels Mosul). So, alas, outrageous bombings civilians. But agricultural targets something altogether different. Academics amassing data Yemen strongly suggests Saudis Yemen campaign contains programme destruction rural livelihood. Martha Mundy, emeritus professor London School Economics, currently working Lebanon colleague Cynthia Gharios, researching Yemeni agriculture ministry statistics says data is beginning show regions, Saudis deliberately striking agricultural infrastructure order destroy civil society. In lecture Beirut, Mundy outlined grievous consequences earlier economic policies Yemen  cheap American wheat 1970s influx food countries discouraged farmers maintaining rural life (terracing farms, example, water husbandry)  effect Saudi Arabias war land. The armies air forces oil-dollar, said,  come destroy physically products Yemeni labour working land animals survived earlier economic devastation. There photographs aplenty destroyed farms, factories dead animals lying fields strewn munitions  effectively preventing farmers returning work many months years. Poultry beehive farms destroyed. Even today, half population Yemen relies part  wholly  agriculture rural husbandry. Mundys research files ministries suggests technical support administration buildings agriculture also attacked. The major Tihama Development Authority Red Sea coastal plain, established 1970s  houses, Mundy says, the written memory years development interventions  responsible series irrigation structures. It heavily bombed twice. But I guess one war  two  Middle East much world take right now. Or much media prepared advertise. Aleppo Mosul quite enough. Yemen much. And Libya.

He also handful notable comments growing specter new cold war, starting assuring world "Russia plan attack anyone", adding "Russian militaty threat myth" although confident many Pentagon would delighted claim opposite. He said NATO outlived usefullness structure topic escalating proxy war Syria, Putin simple comment: "Our agreements US Syria work out." Follow Putin's speech below. President Russia Vladimir Putin : Tarja, Heinz, Thabo, colleagues, ladies gentlemen, It great pleasure see again. I want start thanking participants Valdai International Discussion Club, Russia abroad, constructive part work, I want thank distinguished guests readiness take part open discussion. Our esteemed moderator wished good departure retirement, I wish time comes. This right approach thing do. But I retired yet leader big country. As such, fitting show restraint avoid displays excessive aggressiveness. I think style case. But I think frank other, particularly gathering. I think hold candid, open discussions, otherwise dialogue makes sense would insipid without slightest interest. I think style discussion extremely needed today given great changes taking place world. The theme meeting year, The Future Progress: Shaping World Tomorrow , topical. Last year, Valdai forum participants discussed problems current world order. Unfortunately, little changed better last months. Indeed, would honest say nothing changed. The tensions engendered shifts distribution economic political influence continue grow. Mutual distrust creates burden narrows possibilities finding effective responses real threats challenges facing world today. Essentially, entire globalisation project crisis today Europe, know well, hear voices saying multiculturalism failed. I think situation many respects result mistaken, hasty extent over-confident choices made countries elites quarter-of-a-century ago. Back then, late 1980s-early 1990s, chance accelerate globalisation process also give different quality make harmonious sustainable nature. But countries saw victors Cold War, saw way said openly, took course simply reshaping global political economic order fit interests. To continued.Inside Invisible Government By John Pilger The American journalist, Edward Bernays, often described man invented modern propaganda. The nephew Sigmund Freud, pioneer psycho-analysis, Bernays coined term public relations euphemism spin deceptions. In 1929, persuaded feminists promote cigarettes women smoking New York Easter Parade  behaviour considered outlandish. One feminist, Ruth Booth, declared, Women! Light another torch freedom! Fight another sex taboo! Bernays influence extended far beyond advertising. His greatest success role convincing American public join slaughter First World War. The secret, said, engineering consent people order control regiment [them] according without knowing it. He described the true ruling power society called invisible government. Today, invisible government never powerful less understood. In career journalist film-maker, I never known propaganda insinuate lives go unchallenged. Imagine two cities. Both siege forces government country. Both cities occupied fanatics, commit terrible atrocities, beheading people. But vital difference. In one siege, government soldiers described liberators Western reporters embedded them, enthusiastically report battles air strikes. There front page pictures heroic soldiers giving V-sign victory. There scant mention civilian casualties. In second city  another country nearby  almost exactly happening. Government forces laying siege city controlled breed fanatics. The difference fanatics supported, supplied armed us  United States Britain. They even media centre funded Britain America. Another difference government soldiers laying siege city bad guys, condemned assaulting bombing city  exactly good soldiers first city. Confusing? Not really. Such basic double standard essence propaganda. I referring, course, current siege city Mosul government forces Iraq, backed United States Britain siege Aleppo government forces Syria, backed Russia. One good; bad. What seldom reported cities would occupied fanatics ravaged war Britain United States invaded Iraq 2003. That criminal enterprise launched lies strikingly similar propaganda distorts understanding civil war Syria. Without drumbeat propaganda dressed news, monstrous ISIS Al-Qaida al-Nusra rest jihadist gang might exist, people Syria might fighting lives today. Some may remember 2003 succession BBC reporters turning camera telling us Blair vindicated turned crime century. The US television networks produced validation George W. Bush. Fox News brought Henry Kissinger effuse Colin Powells fabrications. The year, soon invasion, I filmed interview Washington Charles Lewis, renowned American investigative journalist. I asked him, What would happened freest media world seriously challenged turned crude propaganda? He replied journalists done job, there very, good chance would gone war Iraq. It shocking statement, one supported famous journalists I put question  Dan Rather CBS, David Rose Observer journalists producers BBC, wished remain anonymous. In words, journalists done job, challenged investigated propaganda instead amplifying it, hundreds thousands men, women children would alive today, would ISIS siege Aleppo Mosul. There would atrocity London Underground 7 th July 2005. There would flight millions refugees; would miserable camps. When terrorist atrocity happened Paris last November, President Francoi Hollande immediately sent planes bomb Syria  terrorism followed, predictably, product Hollandes bombast France at war showing mercy. That state violence jihadist violence feed truth national leader courage speak. When truth replaced silence, said Soviet dissident Yevtushenko, the silence lie. The attack Iraq, attack Libya, attack Syria happened leader countries puppet West. The human rights record Saddam Gaddafi irrelevant. They obey orders surrender control country. The fate awaited Slobodan Milosevic refused sign agreement demanded occupation Serbia conversion market economy. His people bombed, prosecuted The Hague. Independence kind intolerable. As WikLeaks revealed, Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad 2009 rejected oil pipeline, running country Qatar Europe, attacked. From moment, CIA planned destroy government Syria jihadist fanatics  fanatics currently holding people Mosul eastern Aleppo hostage. Why news? The former British Foreign Office official Carne Ross, responsible operating sanctions Iraq, told me: We would feed journalists factoids sanitised intelligence, would freeze out. That worked. The Wests medieval client, Saudi Arabia  US Britain sell billions dollars worth arms  present destroying Yemen, country poor best times, half children malnourished. Look YouTube see kind massive bombs  our bombs  Saudis use dirt-poor villages, weddings, funerals. The explosions look like small atomic bombs. The bomb aimers Saudi Arabia work side-by-side British officers. This fact evening news. Propaganda effective consent engineered fine education  Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Columbia  careers BBC, Guardia n, New York Times , Washington Post . These organisations known liberal media. They present enlightened, progressive tribunes moral zeitgeist. They anti-racist, pro-feminist pro-LGBT. And love war. While speak feminism, support rapacious wars deny rights countless women, including right life. In 2011, Libya, modern state, destroyed pretext Muammar Gaddafi commit genocide people. That incessant news; evidence. It lie. In fact, Britain, Europe United States wanted like call regime change Libya, biggest oil producer Africa. Gaddafis influence continent and, all, independence intolerable. So murdered knife rear fanatics, backed America, Britain France. Hillary Clinton cheered gruesome death camera, declaring, We came, saw, died! The destruction Libya media triumph. As war drums beaten, Jonathan Freedland wrote Guardian : Though risks real, case intervention remains strong. Intervention  polite, benign, Guardian word, whose real meaning, Libya, death destruction. According records, Nato launched 9,700 strike sorties Libya, third aimed civilian targets. They included missiles uranium warheads. Look photographs rubble Misurata Sirte, mass graves identified Red Cross. The Unicef report children killed says, most [of them] age ten. As direct consequence, Sirte became capital ISIS. Ukraine another media triumph. Respectable liberal newspapers New York Times , Washington Post Guardian , mainstream broadcasters BBC, NBC, CBS, CNN played critical role conditioning viewers accept new dangerous cold war. All misrepresented events Ukraine malign act Russia when, fact, coup Ukraine 2014 work United States, aided Germany Nato. This inversion reality pervasive Washingtons military intimidation Russia news; suppressed behind smear scare campaign kind I grew withduring first cold war. Once again, Ruskies coming get us, led another Stalin, The Economist depicts devil. The suppression truth Ukraine one complete news blackouts I remember. The fascists engineered coup Kiev breed backed Nazi invasion Soviet Union 1941. Of scares rise fascist anti-Semitism Europe, leader ever mentions fascists Ukraine  except Vladimir Putin, count. Many Western media worked hard present ethnic Russian-speaking population Ukraine outsiders country, agents Moscow, almost never Ukrainians seeking federation within Ukraine Ukrainian citizens resisting foreign-orchestrated coup elected government. There almost joie desprit class reunion warmongers. The drum-beaters Washington Post inciting war Russia editorial writers published lie Saddam Hussein weapons mass destruction. To us, American presidential campaign media freak show, Donald Trump arch villain. But Trump loathed power United States reasons little obnoxious behaviour opinions. To invisible government Washington, unpredictable Trump obstacle Americas design 21 st century. This maintain dominance United States subjugate Russia, and, possible, China. To militarists Washington, real problem Trump that, lucid moments, seems want war Russia; wants talk Russian president, fight him; says wants talk president China. In first debate Hillary Clinton, Trump promised first introduce nuclear weapons conflict. He said, I would certainly first strike. Once nuclear alternative happens, its over. That news. Did really mean it? Who knows? He often contradicts himself. But clear Trump considered serious threat status quo maintained vast national security machine runs United States, regardless White House. The CIA wants beaten. The Pentagon wants beaten. The media wants beaten. Even party wants beaten. He threat rulers world  unlike Clinton left doubt prepared go war nuclear-armed Russia China. Clinton form, often boasts. Indeed, record proven. As senator, backed bloodbath Iraq. When ran Obama 2008, threatened totally obliterate Iran. As Secretary State, colluded destruction governments Libya Honduras set train baiting China. She pledged support No Fly Zone Syria  direct provocation war Russia. Clinton may well become dangerous president United States lifetime a distinction competition fierce. Without shred evidence, accused Russia supporting Trump hacking emails. Released WikiLeaks, emails tell us Clinton says private, speeches rich powerful, opposite says public. That silencing threatening Julian Assange important. As editor WikiLeaks, Assange knows truth. And let assure concerned, well, WikiLeaks operating cylinders. Today, greatest build-up American-led forces since World War Two way  Caucasus eastern Europe, border Russia, Asia Pacific, China target. Keep mind presidential election circus reaches finale November 8 th, If winner Clinton, Greek chorus witless commentators celebrate coronation great step forward women. None mention Clintons victims: women Syria, women Iraq, women Libya. None mention civil defence drills conducted Russia. None recall Edward Bernays torches freedom. George Bushs press spokesman called media complicit enablers. Coming senior official administration whose lies, enabled media, caused suffering, description warning history. In 1946, Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutor said German media: Before every major aggression, initiated press campaign calculated weaken victims prepare German people psychologically attack.

To check holds, lets start essential backup. The Queen War, final US presidential debate Las Vegas: " A no-fly zone [in Syria] save lives hasten end conflict. " The Queen War, one 2013 speeches Goldman Sachs, published WikiLeaks: no-fly zone would " kill lot Syrians . The Chairman Joint Chiefs Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, speaking Senate Foreign Relations Committee: no-fly zone Syria  would require us go war, Syria Russia.

Whenever cornered, machine switches narrative Russian hacking DNC. Edward Snowden, knows thing two cyberwarfare, stresses solid proof Russian intel hacked Democratic/Clinton machine. And actually it, NSA would know. The fact NSA mum reveals information war. Pass missile launchers, please Trump seems money insisted Hillary outsmarted  already past  dealing President Putin, demonized Hitler. I shown Hillary prevented launching WWIII no-fly zone already implemented Syria Russia. And Pentagon  reflecting Dunfords comments - knows it, matter emphatically soon-to-be-unemployed Pentagon head Ash Carter threatens  consequences . The Pentagon ranks Russia China number one two existential threats US national security, order. And US government reserves privilege nuclear first-strike  Hillary supports (but Trump); part 2002 Full Spectrum Dominance doctrine. The relentless hysteria crystallized Cold War 2.0 led scores analysts game actual  terrifying - possibility US-Russia hot war. As much Cold War MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) doctrine may lie dust  exactly Washington refuses back first-strike  armchair Dr. Strangeloves get kicks possibility fighting nuclear power. Dunford seem one them. What Hillary Clinton certainly double proxy wars, Vietnam/Afghanistan-style. So expect President Clinton authorize full weaponization Beltway-loved moderate Al-Qaeda-in-Syria rebels plenty shoulder-held missile launchers. This could easily get control  lethal, yet nuclear, consequences. Thats exactly point made Mikhail Rostovsky Moscow daily Moskovsky Komsomolets; Hillary ratchets tensions,  things could get hand . Also expect proxy ratcheting tension South China Sea; Hillary claimed mothership pivot Asia; Hillary steered intra-South East Asian maritime disputes boiling cauldron wider US-China competition.

Or she?America Lackeys Insult People World By Finian Cunningham SCF " - And its Russia Washington insulting  entire world. Such preposterous hypocrisy US leaders international network cronies. US client regime Saudi Arabia  world's repressive  given seat UN human rights council weekend Russia forced one glaring insult among many. Russias top diplomat referring US officials Western allies accusing Russia barbarism war crimes ongoing military intervention Syria. Yet unverified, hysterical charges Washington levels Moscow Syria proven US allies committed huge war crimes dozens countries recent years. Crimes go unaccounted for. Lavrov cited case former Yugoslavia particular where, 1999, US-led NATO warplanes killed thousands civilians air strikes public infrastructure. Since then, illegal overseas wars launched Washington  brazen violation international law  proliferated death toll counted millions. Currently, US forces bombing seven countries, including Iraq, Syria Yemen, inflicting civilian deaths daily basis. Yet Washington Western minions audacity condemn Russia military operations salvage Syria US-led covert war regime change. That US orchestrated criminal covert war Syria since March 2011  violating human rights millions Syrians  shocking reality servile Western media continues conceal. Last week, Western propaganda campaign demonize Russia scored dubious victory Russia dropped United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC). That move achieved back media-driven agenda claiming Russian air strikes indiscriminately targeting civilians northern Syria city Aleppo. Never mind Russian (and Syrian) aircraft carrying combat missions around Aleppo nearly two weeks order facilitate humanitarian aid efforts war-torn city. Never mind aid efforts continually sabotaged foreign-backed terrorist groups holding civilians siege eastern Aleppo past four years. Russias military intervention Syria past year helped Syrian government forces liberate hundreds towns villages reign terror imposed foreign-backed mercenaries, integrated internationally outlawed terrorist networks Islamic State (Daesh) Nusra Front. None given acknowledgment West subservient news media, instead inverts reality amplifying spurious claims leveled Russia terrorist sponsors. The battle Aleppo fully consistent objective liberating Syria US-led criminal conspiracy destroy country replace elected government President Bashar al-Assad pro-Western puppet regime. Over weekend, Western media strained credulity referring rebels breaking regimes siege Aleppo. These so-called rebels none Al Qaeda-linked terrorists Nusra Front myriad offshoots, like Ahrar al-Sham Jaish al-Fatah. It isnt Syrian army Russian ally holding city siege. It terrorists. And weekend shelling resulting dozens civilians killed, including reportedly 14 children government-held western Aleppo. Even abjectly one-sided Western media could conceal slaughter terrorist rebels United States allies supported money, weapons training geopolitical bidding Syria since 2011. Meanwhile, neighboring Iraq, US coalition includes Britain, France Turkey continued bombing city Mosul, ostensibly defeat extremists holding civilian population human shields  extremists US partners covertly supported next door Syria. US-led aerial bombardment Mosul resulted heavy civilian casualties since offensive launched October 17, according local sources. Elsewhere weekend, Saudi warplanes, supported US, Britain France, ratcheted even crimes humanity. Some 10,000 people killed since Saudi coalition began bombing regions poorest country March 2015. In air strike Red Sea port city Hodeida, Saudi warplanes attacked prison, killing 60 inmates security staff. It latest atrocity litany deadly strikes civilian centers, including hospitals, schools, markets, mosques, family homes even funeral halls. Last week, UN agencies reported nearly half Yemeni population 24 million facing starvation. Images skeletal children emerging, wracked dysentery cholera. This barbaric nationwide ordeal created Saudi regime Western patrons imposing sea air blockade country. It exaggeration say whole Yemeni nation imprisoned population bombed without slightest compunction women children blown pieces. Without American, British French military support Saudi slaughter Yemen would cease immediately. Western-backed Saudi claims Iranian subversion Yemen, allegedly supporting Houthi rebels, risible pretext. Washington clients destroying Yemen simply cant abide popular, genuinely pro-democracy uprising succeeding vital oil-rich region underpins US hegemony despotic Arab rule, Saudi Arabia Gulf monarchical dictatorships. On weekend Russia sanctioned UNHRC, yet another blood-soaked orgy state-sponsored terrorism carried US, allies mercenary surrogates. The US, Britain, France Saudi Arabia among 47 member states represented Geneva-based human rights council. The Saudi feudalist monarchy, executes prisoners convicted sorcery crimes public beheading, bans women driving cars, obtained seat UNHRC due Britain fixing votes. Russia, stood terrorist-sponsoring aggression Syria Washington rogue-state partners, singled sanction allegations committing violations. This censure insulting travesty justice. It insult common intelligence see preposterous lies US accomplices. The utter disconnect deception Washington Western governments may fool people time, long-run corruption coming unstuck. The turmoil, anger disdain among ordinary people towards criminals high office reaching boiling point US, Europe across world. The illegitimate rulers seek justify existence criminal enterprises offends ordinary human intelligence. Russia right aggrieved public insults emanate Washington lackeys. But Russia certainly alone grotesquely wronged. The whole world aggrieved putting far international oligarchy thieves, exploiters sponsors terrorism. So far.The Tales Bodies Blood That Surround Front Line Syria By Robert Fisk The Independent " - We arrived soon Jabhat al-Nusras retreat village one man family buried remains four Islamists bottom field. We found back stank much get rid them, Mohamed Kenjo said. So took remains put covering earth away home. But house shared wife six children looted  everything, washing machine water tank, cups saucers kettles  homes Kenjos neighours lay ruins, broken open shells rockets. This front line north Hama, city whose history lay blood insurrection 34 years ago. So close front line, fact, fighter bombers still howling heads attack Islamists  Ahrar al-Sham, Nusra, usual suspects  next village north-west. The Syrians say see jets, Russian fighter-bombers fast its impossible catch naked eye. You could make spray anti-missile flares aircraft released, four five bright stars drifted imperial blue sky like fireworks. But then, planes turned one bombing runs, could see sun caught swept-back wings, daggering heavens south bombs exploded loud, hollow sound like two giant wooden planks banging together ground. Amid soldiers, sweating, tired, general turned up, steel helmet eyes, marching briskly officers ruins. I wanted know many Nusra men died. Many, many, replied. But I asked many Syrian soldiers killed broken, smashed village Soran, answer came without hesitation. We 42 martyrs, said bleakly. I didnt doubt figure. And soldiers tell truth, means winning. But thats lot men lose one dust-covered hamlet. The Syrian armys death toll six years war state secret. But Ive given reliable figure government armys fatalities terrible war: around 75,000. These dead, hundreds thousands wounded. Soldiers expect die. They live sword. Civilians sides innocents whose lives spared. Their mortality statistics come sides, including United Nations. Is 250,000 300,000 UN states? Or 400,000 experts faraway cities claim? Whatever figure, add another 75,000 it. The ruins village Soran north Hama (Nelofer Pazira) The Nusra men allies captured place two half months ago. House house Soran blown apart. Some remained, doors ajar, bougainvillea still spilling concrete walls. But always, I walked inside, cupboards torn open retreating Islamists, piles childrens clothes toys clocks family snapshots scattered across floor. One picture showed baby smiling cot, another husband wife surrounded children. The Islamists probably looking money hidden cupboards. But looters want washing machine? Did plan lug rubbish away retreat? What happened lived here? There doubt tragedy one middle-aged man. He stood forlornly street beside huge bomb crater surrounded heavy, jagged pieces steel casing lay feet. I policeman Hama, said. My father stayed behind. He old man. And day left, killers murdered him. They shot back home. And led fathers blackened house pushed open door small, darkened closet. We found there, floor, said. Other Syrian villagers, returning Islamists fled, told similar stories, missing women, bodies wreckage. Highways seem survive wars, history insists basic geography society remain mapped amid ruins villages later reconstruction. So main road, fled invaders last August turned pick-up trucks old cars see remained homes, collect detritus left. In neighbouring village Maardes, I found woman daughter  name Qamar, means moon, returned real moonscape. She Qamar found part wardrobe mat carpet loaded pathetically onto pick-up relative brought Hama. In different age, 1982, Muslim Brotherhood  pale ghost compared Islamists today  staged fearful insurrection city, put equal ferocity Hafez al-Assads army years ago. The statistics long dead civilians died governments reprisals slippery todays death toll. Was five six thousand? Or 20,000 journalists claimed time? Many ruins Hamas old city bulldozed away make room new apartment blocks luxury hotel. But ancient houses remain beside ancient nouriah water wheels still wail creak away haunted city. Its Sunni Muslim citizens quiet now. Maybe learned terrible lesson. Or maybe government learned treat respect, leaving new generations new-found trade wealth schools. Today, market packed shoppers, feels like memory old, dubiously safe dictatorship dominated Syria war; content, subdued, careful, aware  use old British wartime maxim  careless talk costs lives. Brotherhood prisoners back 1982 later slaughtered prison massacre Palmyra. The Ibrahim mosque still displays three-decade old shell hole minaret. But Nusra let city forget past. Less month ago, suicide bomber set truck load explosives outside Baath party headquarters. One governor assassinated. Its relief drive north wooded hillside whose burned trees massive earth revetments show artillery position days ago. Two 120mm guns stand parapet plain Hama. On top hill, stands almost untouched shrine Ali Ibn Hussein al-Abdin, fourth Imam survived seventh century battle Kerbala, Shiite holy place  Alawi sect al-Assads belong Shia  soldiers arrived battlefront pray kiss black marble shrine beneath cupola antiquity. A major later stood outside courtyard pointed horizon. You could see 30  perhaps 40  miles across flat, featureless countryside around 7,000 armed opponents Assad regime still fighting retake lost villages cut desert military supply road Aleppo. Are Nusra men? A Isis members, doubt. Perhaps moderate rebels David Cameron, former British prime minister seemingly invented. And long Syrian army could recapture lands ran seventy miles Aleppo linked Turkish border north city? The major looked across vast expanse territory. Then pointed sky opened hands. The gesture said all. Only God knows.Purchasing Loyalty Foreign Aid By Jacob G. Hornberger FFF " - A dispute taking place Saudi Arabia Egypt indirectly demonstrates nature U.S. foreign aid. After dumping walloping $25 billion foreign aid help Egyptian military dictatorships economic woes, Saudis hopping mad. Why? Because last month United Nations, contrary Saudi Arabias wishes, Egypt voted favor Russian resolution Syria. In world foreign aid, thats super no-no. When regime received $25 billion another regime, expected vote way benefactor wants vote. In remarkable admission regarding foreign aid, least particular case, New York Times , article matter, wrote, The Saudis may thought buying loyalty . The Times article pointed punish Egyptians independence, The state-owned Saudi oil company, Aramco, postponed promised shipment 700,000 tons discounted oil October, spokesman Egypts oil ministry said fate Novembers shipment remains unknown. Although New York Times would probably reluctant describe U.S. foreign aid way, thats precisely  way purchase loyalty foreign regimes, including dictatorships. The U.S. government loves put foreign regimes federal dole happens, U.S. officials know bought them, lock, stock, barrel. Once regime dole, inevitably becomes dependent it. The racket works like this: The IRS collects money hard-pressed U.S. taxpayers, U.S. officials use send millions dollars foreign aid foreign regimes. The foreign regimes use money buy weaponry fortify hold power line pockets government officials. It doesnt matter U.S. officials tyrants people within country. They abuse them, incarcerate them, torture them, kill them. None matters U.S. officials. What matters U.S. officials international arena. Like votes UN. Or public support U.S. invasions, coups, interventions, assassinations, kidnappings, like. Or joining coalitions willing. Thats U.S. officials expect loyalty, form blind support, Saudi Arabia expecting Egyptian tyrants. And heaven help nation takes wrong position. The U.S. respond way Saudis responded Egyptians. It threaten bad things nation opposes U.S invasion, coup, resolution within UN. When nation U.S. dole, U.S. officials expect loyalty. Americans cant anything foreign aid Saudi government. But something U.S. foreign aid. What demand ended, immediately. Jacob G. Hornberger founder president The Future Freedom Foundation.

By Dennis Kucinich The Nation " - W ashington, DC, may place world people openly flaunt pseudo-intellectuality banding together, declaring think tanks, raising money external interests, including foreign governments, compile reports advance policies inimical real-life concerns American people. As former member House Representatives, I remember 16 years congressional hearings pedigreed experts came advocate wars testimony based circular, rococo thinking devoid depth, reality, truth. I remember hearings Pentagon unable reconcile $1 trillion accounts, lost track $12 billion cash sent Iraq, rigged missile-defense test interceptor could easily home target. War first foremost profitable racket. How else explain past 15 years citys called bipartisan foreign policy elite promoted wars Iraq Libya, interventions Syria Yemen, opened Pandoras box trusting world, tune trillions dollars, windfall military contractors. DCs think tanks rightly included taxonomy armored war vehicles gathering places refugees academia. According front page past Fridays Washington Post , bipartisan foreign-policy elite recommends next president show less restraint President Obama. Acting urging liberal hawks brandishing humanitarian intervention, read war, Obama administration attacked Libya along allied powers working NATO. The think tankers fell line Iraq invasion. Not tank, I analysis call war October 2002, based readily accessible information, easily concluded justification war. I distributed widely Congress led 125 Democrats voting Iraq war resolution. There money made conclusion war uncalled for, so, millions protesting United States worldwide, government launched abyss, lot armchair generals waving combat pennants. The marching band chowder society DC think tanks learned nothing Iraq Libya experience. The winners arms dealers, oil companies, jihadists. Immediately fall Libya, black flag Al Qaeda raised municipal building Benghazi, Gadhafis murder soon follow, Secretary Clinton quipping laugh, We came, saw, died. President Obama apparently learned misadventure, Washington policy establishment, spoiling war. The self-identified liberal Center American Progress (CAP) calling Syria bombed, estimates Americas current military adventures tidied 2025, tardy twist mission accomplished. CAP, according report The Nation , received funding war contractors Lockheed Martin Boeing, make bombers CAP wants rain hellfire Syria. The Brookings Institute taken tens millions foreign governments , notably Qatar, key player military campaign oust Assad. Retired four-star Marine general John Allen Brookings senior fellow . Charles Lister senior fellow Middle East Institute , received funding Saudi Arabia , major financial force providing billions arms upend Assad install Sunni caliphate stretching across Iraq Syria. Foreign-government money driving foreign policy. As drumbeat expanded war gets louder, Allen Lister jointly signed op-ed Sunday Washington Post , calling attack Syria. The Brookings Institute, report Congress , admitted received $250,000 US Central Command, Centcom, General Allen shared leadership duties General David Petraeus. Pentagon money think tanks endorse war? This academic integrity, DC-style. And Central Command, well Food Drug Administration, US Department transportation, US Department Health Human Services giving money Brookings ? Former secretary state Madeleine Albright, famously told Colin Powell , Whats point superb military youre always talking cant use it, predictably says current moment , We think needs American action. A former Bush administration top adviser also calling United States launch cruise missile attack Syria. The American people fed war, concerted effort made fearmongering, propaganda, lies prepare country dangerous confrontation, Russia Syria. The demonization Russia calculated plan resurrect r aison dętre stone-cold warriors trying escape dustbin history evoking specter Russian world domination. Its infectious. Earlier year BBC broadcast fictional show contemplated WWIII, beginning Russian invasion Latvia (where 26 percent population ethnic Russian 34 percent Latvians speak Russian home). The imaginary WWIII scenario conjures Russias targeting London nuclear strike. No wonder summer 2016 poll showed two-thirds UK citizens approved new British PMs launching nuclear strike retaliation. So much learning lessons detailed Chilcot report. As years presidential election comes conclusion, Washington ideologues regurgitating bipartisan consensus kept America war since 9/11 made world decidedly dangerous place. The DC think tanks provide cover political establishment, political safety net, fictive analytical framework providing moral rationale intervention, capitol casuistry. Im fed DC policy elite cash war presenting experts, cost peoples lives, national fortune, sacred honor country. Any report advocating war comes alleged think tank ought accompanied list think tanks sponsors donors statement lobbying connections reports authors. It patriotic duty expose DC foreign-policy establishment sponsors learned failures instead repeating them, acquiescence political class sleepwalkers press passes. It also time new peace movement America, one includes progressives libertarians alike, Congress, organize campuses, cities, towns across America, serve effective counterbalance Demuplican war party, think tanks, media cheerleaders. The work begins now, Inauguration. We must accept war inevitable, leaders would lead us direction, whether Congress White House, must face visible opposition.

Brazil Argentina, powerful richest countries South America Philippines, Washingtons strategic military platform Southeast Asia, objects intense US political operations run-up 2016. In instance, Wall Street Pentagon secured smashing successes leading premature ejaculations new golden era financial pillage unfettered military adventures. Unfortunately, early ecstasy turned agony: Wall Street made easy entries even faster departures honeymoon gave way reality. ; The political procurers persecuted center-left incumbents but, soon turn facing prosecution. The political prostitutes, decreed sale sovereignty, replaced nationalists would turn bordello back sovereign nation state. This essay outlines rapid rise dramatic demise erstwhile progeny Wall Street Pentagon Argentina Brazil, reviews Washingtons shock awe newly elected Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte embraced new ties China proclaiming, We ones tuta (puppy dog)! Argentina Brazil: Grandiose Schemes Crapulous Outcomes The international financial press ecstatic election President Mauricio Macri Argentina appointment former Wall Street bankers cabinet. They celebrated ouster evil populists, accusing inflating economic results, reneging debt obligations discouraging foreign lenders investors. Under Macri regime market obstacles removed bankers trembled anticipation good times come. After taking office December 2015, President Macri unleashed animal instincts market carrion birds flocked in. US vulture funds scooped demanded payment old Argentine debt valued $3.5 billion  constituting 1,000% return initial investment. A devaluation peso 50% tripled inflation drove wages 20%. Firing 200,000 public sector employees, slapping 400% price increases utilities transport, driving small medium size firms bankruptcy enraged consumers streets ended honeymoon Argentine electorate quite abruptly. This initial massive dose free enterprise medicine prescribed local Wall Street bankers investors promised new golden era capitalism! Now banished populists, Macri free tap international financial markets. Argentina raised $16.5 billion bond sale taken big bankers speculators, mostly Wall Street, eager cash high rates belief risk champion President Macri helm. Wall Street based giddy predictions mere three-month experience Mauricio! But hedge fund managers began raise questions viability Mauricio Macris presidency. Instead reducing fiscal deficit, Macri began increase public spending offset mass discontent triple digit increases utility fees transportation, mass layoffs public sector slashing pension funds. The major banks counted abrupt devaluation currency invest export sector, instead confronted sudden 11% appreciation peso skyrocketing inflation 40% leading high interest rates. As result, economy fell even deeper recession exceeding minus 3% year. While Wall Street bankers still retain faith Macri regime, willing fork-over kind cash might allow increasingly unpopular regime survive. What keep Wall Street board sinking ship political ideological commitments rather objective assessment protégées dismal economic performance. Wall Street counts free market bankers appointed ministries, massive purge social services (health education) personnel lucrative bond sales cover burgeoning deficit. They hope vast increase profits resulting increased utility fees sharp cuts salaries, pensions subsidies ultimately lead promised land. Wall Street expressed dismay Macris failure stimulate growth  fact GDP falling. Furthermore, golden boy failed attract productive investments. Instead thousands Argentine small medium businesses gone under consumer spending tanked extortionate tariffs slapped vital public utilities transport  devastating profits. Inflation undermined purchasing power vast majority households. Wall Street speculators, concentrating fixed-rate peso denominated debt, risk losing shirts. In words, administrations free enterprise regime based largely attracting foreign loans, plundering national treasury, firing tens thousands public sector workers slashing spending social services business-friendly subsidies. Macri yet generate large-scale investment new innovative productive sectors, might sustain long-term growth. Already facing growing discontent general strike private public sector workers, bankers regime lacks political links trade unions neutralize growing opposition. To hold back growing tidal wave discontent, President Macri betray overseas investors boosting fiscal spending, little impact national economy. Wall Streets hopes President Mauricio Macri would inaugurate golden era free market capitalism lasted less year turning real fiasco. Rising foreign debt, economic depression class warfare ensures Macris rapid demise. Brazil: Wall Streets Three Month Whirl-Wind Honeymoon Most current elected members Brazilian Congress, Senate recently-installed (rather elected) President, well cabinet, trouble: The hero, Michael Temer argonauts, chosen Wall Street privatize Brazilian economy usher another golden dawn finance capital, face criminal changes, arrest long prison sentences money laundering, bribery, fraud, tax evasion corruption. In less four months, entire political edifice constructed impeach elected President Dilma Rousseff de-nationalize key sectors economy, shaking. So much financial presss proclamation new era business friendly policies Brazilia. The pundits, politicians, journalists editors, prematurely celebrated appointment Michael Temer Presidency legislative coup, face new reality. The key understanding rapid collapse New Right project Brazil lies growing rap sheets politicians engineered ouster Rousseff. Eduardo Cunha, ex-president Congress Brasilia, used influence ensure super majority Congressional votes impeachment. Cunha godfather ensuring appointment Michael Temer interim president. Cunhas influence control Congress based wide network bribes corruption involving hundred members congress, including newly anointed President Temer. Once Cunha secured ouster Rousseff, Brazilian elite washed collective hands fixer, overwhelmed stench corruption. In September 2016, Cunha suspended Congress lost immunity. One month later, arrested dozen charges, including fraud tax evasion. It public knowledge Cunha squirreled away tidy nest $70 million Swiss banks. Cunha directed (extorted) public private firms finance campaigns many political colleagues. He intervened secure bribes President Temer, foreign minister even next presidential hopeful, Jose Serra. One powerful representatives new regime, Moreira Franco, Grand Wizard Privatization Program, in hock Cunha. As come light, Cunha negotiating plea bargain prosecutor judges return singing arias. He facing hundred years jail; wife daughter face trial; Eduardo Cunha prepared talk finger political leaders save neck. Most knowledgeable observers judicial experts fully expect Cunha bring Temer Administration devastate leadership Temers Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, well ex-president Fernando Henrique Cardosos Brazilian Social Democratic Party. The Brazilian elite, Wall Street bankers mass media propagandists, wrote directed impeachment plot scenario discredited bereft political front men. Their expectations new golden era free market capitalism Brazil turned political mad scramble every politico corporate leader desperate save skin illicit fortune denouncing other. With demise Brazilian takeover, Wall Street Washington bereft key markets allies Latin America. The Philippines: The Duterte turn US China In April 2014, Washington secured agreement granting access five strategic military bases Philippines critical pivot target China. Under outgoing President Noynoy Aquino, Jr. Pentagon believed iron-clad agreement organize Philippines satrap military springboard throughout Southeast Asia. Washington even prodded Aquino government bring Spratly Island dispute China obscure Permanent Court Arbitration Hague. Washington anticipated using Courts favorable ruling pretext confront Chinese. All changed June 2016 ascent Presidency Rodrigo Duterte: In four months, Washingtons imperial designs swept table. By October 21, 2016 President Duterte announced would end military exercises Washington threatened Philippine sovereignty made country vulnerable military confrontation China. He promised end sea patrols disputed waters US uses harass China South China Sea. In advance Philippines Presidents meeting China, already declared would press Dutch-based ruling South China Sea island dispute Beijing rely diplomacy compromise. During China meeting President Duterte declared two countries would engage constructive dialogue resolve Spratly Islands well outstanding issues. The agreement US access bases Philippines put doubt President declared a separation US promised long-term, large scale economic investment ties China. Undergirding Philippines pivot China 13 trade investment agreements worth $20 billion, covering financing infrastructure, transport, social projects, tourism, industry agriculture. The military base agreement, signed notoriously servile ex-President Aquino without Congressional approval, review Philippine Supreme Court revoked new President Duterte decree. Inside four months, US strategy armed encirclement intervention China dealt major blow. The newly emerging China-Philippines linkage strikes fatal blow Washingtons overtly militarist pivot China. Conclusion 2016 opened great fanfare: The defeat two major center-left governments (Argentina Brazil) advent hard-right US-backed regimes would inaugurate golden era free market capitalism. This promised usher prolonged period profit pillage rolling back populist reforms creating bankers paradise. In Southeast Asia, US officials pundits would proclaim another golden era, time rampant militarism, encircling provoking China vital sea lanes, operating five strategic military bases obtained Philippine Presidential decree unpopular recently replaced puppet, Noynoy Aquino, Jr. These dreams golden eras lasted months objective reality intruded. By autumn 2016 rightist regimes replaced Manila colorful ardent nationalist, banker boys Brasilia faced prison, Golden Boys Buenos Aires mired deep crisis. The notion easy Rightist restoration based several profound misunderstandings: 1) The belief reversal social reforms denial popular demands would smoothly give way explosion foreign financing investment shattered private bond purchases profited financial sector bring large-scale productive investment. Devaluation currency followed skyrocketing inflation, led fiscal deficits loss business confidence. 2) Washingtons promotion corruption investigations started prosecuting democratically elected center-left politicians ended arrest Wall Streets protégés encompassing entire right-wing political class decimating Golden regimes. 3) The belief long-term hegemonic relations, based client regimes Asia, could resist attraction signing trade investment agreements rising Chinese mega-economy, sacrificing vital economic development, relegating masses stagnation unemployment, collapsed massive electoral nationalist Rodrigo Duterte President Philippines. In fact, political assessments among decision makers Washington Wall Street proven wrong leading strategic retreat empire Latin America Asia. The policy failures merely mistakes inevitable results changing structural conditions embedded declining empire. These decisions based calculus power, rooted class national relations may held true two decades ago. At dawn new millennium US still dominated Asia China yet economic alternative neighbors eager investment. Washington could dictate policy Southeast Asia. Twenty years ago, US economic leverage sustain neoliberal policies Washington Consensus throughout Latin America. Today US continues pursue policies based anachronistic power relations, seeming ignore fact China world power viable economic trade investment alternative successfully competing markets influence Asia. Washington failing compete marketplace and, therefore, longer rely docile client state. Washington cannot effectively control direct large-scale capital flows shore-up newly installed rightist regimes Argentina Brazil crumble corruption incompetence. Meanwhile world watching domestic US economy, mired stagnation political elites torn corruption scandals highest level, staging bizarre presidential campaign history. Corruption become mode governing conditions deregulation rule political warlords. Political allegiance empire open doors foreign pillage attract capital making political decisions facing prison business doormen busy stuffing suitcases cash making mad-dash airports! For Wall Street Pentagon, Latin America Asia lost opportunities  betrayals mourned officers clubs exclusive Manhattan restaurants. For people mass social movements emerging opportunities struggle change. The strenuous US effort rebuild empire Latin America Southeast Asia suffered rapid succession blows. Washington still seize power lacks talent favorable conditions hold it. The vision Brazilian state, build edifice privatized oil giant, Petrobras, political incarceration left adversaries, foreign capital attracted seduced political procurers, pimps prostitutes, ended debacle. In vacuum, new governments peoples movements seize opportunity advance struggles explore political economic alternatives. The aborted rightist power grab inadvertently done peoples movements great favor exposing ousting corrupt compromised center-left regimes opening door genuine anti-imperialist transformation.

The US-led military alliance planning speed mobilization forces numbering tens thousands and, ultimately, hundreds thousands millions mobilized Russia. Beyond existing 5,000-strong emergency response force, NATO tripling incumbent response force 40,000 putting hundreds thousands troops higher alert levels. The Times wrote, Sir Adam West, Britains outgoing permanent representative NATO, said thought goal speed response time 300,000 military personnel two months. At present force size could take 180 days deploy. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said, We addressing call follow-on forces. There large number people armed forces NATO allies. We looking ready shorter notice. According Times , Stoltenberg explained NATO looking broadly methods improving readiness many alliance's three million soldiers, sailors, airmen Marines. The target deployments, largest since dissolution Soviet Union Stalinist bureaucracy end Cold War quarter century ago, Russia. We seen assertive Russia implementing substantial military build-up many years, tripling defence spending since 2000 real terms; developing new military capabilities; exercising forces using military force neighbours, Stoltenberg said. We also seen Russia using propaganda Europe among NATO allies exactly reason NATO responding. We responding biggest reinforcement collective defence since end Cold War. These statements show NATO planning horrific war Russia continued behind backs people throughout US presidential election campaign. Military deployments war preparations Pentagon general staffs various European countries set go ahead, moreover, whatever outcome election United States slated 2017 European NATO countries. Stoltenberg's vague attack Russian propaganda Europe allusion instinctive opposition war exists European international working class popular distrust anti-Russian propaganda promoted NATO officials like Stoltenberg West. Last year, Pew poll found broad international opposition NATO participation conventional war Russia Eastern Europe, even scenario assumes Russia started conflict. Under hypothetical conditions, 58 percent Germans, 53 percent French people, 51 percent Italians opposed military action Russia. Opposition war poll would doubtless higher pollsters mentioned NATO's decision attack Russian forces Eastern Europe could lead nuclear war. This opposition rooted deep disaffection imperialist Middle East wars post-Soviet period memory two world wars Europe 20th century. The arguments Stoltenberg presented politically fraudulent. The primary threat military aggression war Europe comes Russia, NATO countries. Over past 25 years, imperialist powers NATO bombed invaded countries Central Asia, Middle East Africa. Within Europe, bombed Serbia Kosovo Balkan Wars 1990s, pushed NATOs borders hundreds miles East, backed violent, fascist-led putsch topple pro-Russian government Ukraine 2014. The aggressive character NATO policy emerged last Friday, NBC News reported US cyber warfare units hacked key Russian electricity, Internet military networks. These vulnerable attack secret American cyber weapons US deem necessary, NBC stated. Russian officials denounced activities highlighted report Obama White House's silence matter. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, If official reaction American administration follows, would mean state cyber terrorism exists US. If threats attack, published US media, carried out, Moscow would justified charging Washington. The geo-strategically disastrous consequences Stalinist bureaucracy's dissolution Soviet Union restoration capitalism Eastern Europe ever apparent. With NATO troops proxy forces stationed geographic belt extending Baltic republics Poland, Ukraine Romaniaeither short distance Russia's bordersNATO poised major war Russia could escalate nuclear conflagration. An examination Stoltenbergs remarks shows NATOs plans defensive preparations counter sudden conventional invasion Europe Russian army. In scenario, Russian tank columns would overrun thousand tens thousands troops NATOs various emergency response forces, depriving broader ranks NATO follow-up forces 60 180 days need mobilize. Rather, plan mobilizing successive layers follow-on forces intended allow NATO threaten Russia crisis situation gradually bringing bear collective military strength, which, although split 28 member states, outweighs Russia. Russia's population 145 million far smaller NATO countries, 906 million. The aggressive character NATOs agenda illustrated report issued last month CIA-linked Rand Corporation think tank military situation Baltic republics Lithuania, Latvia Estonia. The small military forces NATO posted Baltic republics, Rand wrote, inviting devastating war, rather deterring it. They calculated Russian forces, actually invaded, could overrun countries approximately 60 hours. On basis, think tank called launching vast NATO military build-up Baltic republics, virtually gates St. Petersburg. It wrote would take a force seven brigades, including three heavy armored brigadesadequately supported air power, land-based fires, enablers ground ready fight onset hostilities prevent rapid overrun Baltic states. This would cost NATO countries $2.7 billion year. As NATO countries intensify threats Russia, increasingly bitter conflicts among NATO imperialist powers themselves. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi bluntly opposed new sanctions Russia called Washington last month's European Union summit Brussels, deepening tensions Germany United States officials Berlin Paris call independent EU military. Prospects increased US-led military provocations Russia sharpening tensions within Europe. In article titled Whether Clinton Trump wins, Germany things get uncomfortable, German news magazine Der Spiegel warned long-term implications aggressive US-led policy Russia, assumed would continue regardless two candidates secured White House. The magazine wrote, The motto be: If want (nuclear) US protection Putin, must either pay us money re-arm yourself. Copyright Š 1998-2016 World Socialist Web Site - All rights reservedStanding Rock Imperialism Itself By Gary Leupp November 09, 2016 " Information Clearing House " - " Counterpunch " - The Dakota Access Pipeline originally scheduled cross state North Dakota north Bismarck, state capital (pop. 70,000). But route shifted 40 miles south, south, pass Standing Rock Sioux reservation (pop. 8200). This sovereign territory Sioux, whose reservation straddles North South Dakota whose members include Hunkpapa Lakota Yaktonai Dakota. The Sioux nation 170,000 people, divided linguistically Lakotas, Dakotas Nakotas concentrated North South Dakota. We know either Wisconsin Minnesota 1660 French traders met recorded encounter. They may advanced Dakotas that. (I mention details suggest Sioux always current zone. Native American tribeslike Germanic, Celtic, Slavic, Turkish Bantu tribes elsewheremigrated settled time, sometimes reached new territory simultaneous first Europeans arrival. For example: Apache may migrated U.S. Southwest 500 years ago, Spanish conquistadors arriving. Since spoke Athabaskan language, seems likely descended people lived Alaska 500 years earlier. They wandered long way home. The Inuit, originated Siberia 10,000 years ago, entered Alaskas North Slope around 3000 BCE started spreading throughout islands Canadian Arctic Peninsula around 1000 CE reaching Greenland short time. They arrived large island around time Scandinavians did. Both come long way. We always question My people always here allegation. The native/settler dichotomy simplistic. We come somewhere else.) The Standing Rock Reservations boundaries defined Fort Laramie Treaty (or Horse Creek Treaty) 1851, exchanged Sioux recognition the right United States Government establish roads, military posts, within respective territories territory U.S. commitment to protect aforesaid Indian nations commission depredations people said United States, ratification treaty. They confirmed another treaty signed 1868. Back Dakota Access Pipeline. According Bismarck Tribune , route changed due concern DAPL, built Sunoco projected send 500,000 gallons oil every day North Dakota Illinois, would endanger water supply citys residents. (These way 92% white, 4% Native American, 4% other. Full disclosure: father born grew raised North Dakota, father him. I visited Bismarck multiple times childhood. One mothers brothers worked government there. It white place.) The water issue first issue (of two) raised protesting DAPL raise. The Missouri River constitutes reservation border peoples source water. (Specifically, Lake Oahe, large swelling within river straddling two Dakotas.) It present quite pure. The pipeline flow beneath it. The Army Corps Engineers assessed pose threat water, people point reports pipelines leak. The Standing Rock Sioux arguing court pipeline directly violates tribes rights sovereign nation hurt drinking water resources. Quick Google search: AP reports 1995 present, 2,000 significant accidents involving oil petroleum pipelines country, producing billions dollars damage. Incidents rose 2006 2015 60%. From 2013 2015, average 121 accidents happened every year. The Yellowstone River pipeline leak spilled 50,000 gallons oil Glendale, Montana water supply March 2015. 6000 residents time instructed drink water, like Flint residents 2014, although involved different poisoning issue. Just check Wikipedias list pipeline accidents U.S. 21st century . It includes entry: In January [2005], Mid-Valley owned Sunoco operated pipeline ruptured, spilling 260,000 US gallons (980,000 L) oil Kentucky Ohio rivers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fined companies $2.5 million spill. In words, Standing Rock Sioux good reason concern quality environment health Sunocos hands, outrage manner Army Corps Engineers conducted environmental impact assessment. And fact route shifted south Bismarck Indian Country precisely due fears water contaminationwhat unbridled racism? The second issue sacred burial sites. This might seem less important, especially irreligious outsider. But ongoing protest observances conducted representatives many tribes North Dakota involve many religious practices related identity: sacred songs dancing, prayers, peace pipes, sweat lodge meetings, water protection rituals. They believe strongly appropriate handling burial grounds. This mean demanding respect boundaries discrete cemetery site rather recognition broad swathe sovereign land long used burial purposes off-limits (to Quote: treaty again) depredations people United States typically accompany projects. It seems reasonable demand recognition burial sites, especially infuriating provocative actions U.S. relation native peoples involved treatment latters remains. The National Park Service recently built $ 3 million boardwalk native sacred burial sites spent tax dollars damaging 78 sites. It built 200 sacred mounds without impact analysis and, according Congressional report know wrong. And theres long history theft exploitation Native Americans remains. Doesnt Yale Universitys Skull Bones Society still boast acquired Geronimos skull 1910s? The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe accused pipeline goons knowingly destroying sacred sites. So this, too, reason oppose DAPL. But main reason opposition water purity, even respect ones ancestors, Sioux tribes aspirations sovereignty, land assigned violated treaties, come capitalist imperialism itself. Why treaties violated, still? Isnt private property, oil profits, indifference environment, inevitable state support biggest property-ownersthat say, isnt system itself? Which all, different ways, oppose? It beautiful see Cannon Ball, North Dakota, largest gatherings recent times representatives native peoples many tribes, many allies many places movements, defense rights.

The jeep might gift borrowed Israel By Robert Fisk November 10, 2016 " Information Clearing House " - " The Independent " - From Colonel Salehs forward position front line north Quneitra, unique exclusive view Syrian war. To west south vast area country occupied Jabhat al-Nusra Islamist fighters  earthen ramparts supply roads scarcely half mile away. Then, another couple miles away, Israeli soldiers inside concrete positions occupied Syrian Golan Heights, old Nusra-held Syrian city Quneitra. You see mosque there, right water tower? colonel asks. Well, Nusra there. And see triangular hill beyond? The Israelis there. Its call politically intriguing battlefield  yes, shells come whizzing towards Syrians Nusra also Israelis. The Syrians concentrate fire Nusra Nusras casualties often taken Israeli lines hospital treatment Haifa. So whose side Israel on? Baath City concrete conurbation created back pre-civil war days defy vandalisation old Quenitra. It occupied Israeli army 1973 Middle East war  abandoned Kissinger agreement  totally destroyed explosives Israeli troops. Nusra occupy 43-year old ruins. As Baath City, university, banks, fire station, schools, police force hospitals defiantly maintained Syrians eyes two enemies: Nusra Islamists Israelis. According Syrian army Baath City  forward lines tanks positioned unfinished apartment blocks edge town  intelligence departments Hebrew speakers constantly monitor conversations Israelis Israeli Nusra fighters. They know  Israelis made secret fact  wounded Nusrah fighters taken Haifa hospital treatment. On one occasion, Nusrah man travelling Israeli ambulance Golan dragged vehicle lynched crowd enraged Druze men largely loyal Syrian government regard Nusrah mortal enemies. Reports mans murder highlighted highly ambiguous relationship Israel Islamists, whose name-changing cannot conceal al-Qaeda roots. Druze towns inside Syria close Baath City taken side regime  apply Druze areas  makes geography front line surreal. One Syrian lieutenant described directed artillery fire onto Israeli jeep Nusra-occupied town Al-Hamidiya inside Syria destroyed it. The jeep might gift borrowed Israel  whether Israeli personnel inside hit another matter. The Syrians, however, also say Israeli bulldozers used build new supply route Nusrah Quneitra Golan  again, inside Syrias frontiers. All raises compelling question. The Nusra-controlled territory Syrians Israeli lines Golan  Islamist groups remnants old Free Syrian Army allied location  stretches way south edge Syrian city Deraa right Jordanian frontier. And beyond frontier so-called Military Operations Centre  MOC Islamists Syrian army refer  Western intelligence officers maintain liaison weapons supply depot anti-government Syrian forces. So relationship MOC Western backers  maintain contact Nusra  Israelis treat Nusras wounded hospitals? The Jordanian border Israeli lines Golan 70 miles apart opposition fighters hold land between. Littered around front lines outside Baath City wreckage past battles abandoned UN posts Filipino UN soldiers kidnapped en masse year ago; Syrian army occupies several positions, UN logo still painted walls although several igloo-type UN accommodation huts migrated Syrian compounds rear lines.

They Bedouins farmers, unsettled landowners, always prey wolves civil war insurgents.

But no. I know every stone here, colonel says. I see rock vehicle moved across fields front us  I immediately see one vehicle become two vehicles. We know going attack  always precede offensives big artillery mortar barrage. Sometimes voices Nusra men shout insults Syrians radio sets, calling kafirs  infidels unbelievers. If I good mood, I invite coffee, Colonel Saleh says. If Im bad mood, I silent. Their accents similar Jordanians. They come south Deraa, along Jordanian border. As spoke, line, Syrians Nusra fighting tanks, artillery mortars. The Syrians claimed enemies arrived several directions convoy least 13 vehicles. They spoke, too, Nusra female officer called Souad al-Qatahani (nicknamed Al-Nood), 30-year-old sister Nusrah general called Qais al-Omani commanded 1,200 fighters.

A Few Possibilities By David M Jackson November 10, 2016 " Information Clearing House " - " USA Today " - After stunning win upended American political landscape, President-elect Donald Trump top advisers must put together White House staff Cabinet  group may well include advisers. Here possibilities powerful roles new Trump administration : Rudy Giuliani The ex-New York City mayor became one Trump's highest-profile surrogates. The former prosecutor could line attorney general. Newt Gingrich The ex-House speaker became top adviser television spokesperson Trump campaign even among real estate mogul's finalists running mate. He said interested becoming secretary State. Bob Corker The chairman Senate Foreign Relations Committee could also possibility lead State Department. Ben Carson A onetime Trump rival, Carson emerged one Trump's steadfast surrogates. The renowned physician would obvious candidate surgeon general. Mike Flynn The retired general emerged Trump's visible military adviser. He could line Defense secretary national security position. Jeff Sessions During primary campaign, Sessions became first sitting member U.S. Senate endorse Trump's campaign. Now, Alabama senator could another possibility lead Pentagon. Reince Priebus The chairman Republican National Committee  ran Trump campaign's get-out-the-vote operation  could wind Trump's White House chief staff. Steve Mnuchin Trump's finance chairman, formerly Goldman Sachs, line possibly become Treasury secretary. Chris Christie Though shadowed recent Bridgegate trial, New Jersey governor fixture Trump's side since endorsing February likely eye spot new administration Justice Department White House.

Schlesinger, Jr., The Crisis Old Order By Paul Craig Roberts Who anti-Trump protesters besmirching name progressives pretending progressives refusing accept outcome presidential election? They look like, acting worse than, white trash denouncing. I think I know are. They thugs hire paid Oligarchy delegitimize Trumps presidency way Washington German Marshall Fund paid students Kiev protest democratically elected Ukrainian government order prepare way coup. The organization, change.org, claims progressive group, might front, along progressive groups, Oligarchy, destroying reputation progressives circulating petition directs electors Electoral Collage annul election casting votes Hillary. Remember upset progressives Trump said might accept election result evidence vote rigged? Now progressives damned Trump saying might certain conditions. The Western presstitutes used protests Kiev delegitimize democratically elected government set coup. The protest pay good enough non-Ukrainians came nearby countries participate protest order collect money. At time I posted amounts paid daily protesters. Reports came Eastern Western Europe people Ukrainian paid protest Ukrainians. The thing going Trump protests. CNN reports for many Americans across country, Donald Trumps victory outcome simply refuse accept. Tens thousands filled streets least 25 US cities overnight. This exact reporting Oligarchy desired presstitutes got. I hope one thinks simultaneous protests 25 cities spontaneous event. How 25 independent protests manage come slogans signs night following election? What point protests, interest served them? As Romans always asked, who benefits? There one answer: The Oligarchy Oligarchy benefits. Trump threat Oligarchy, intends stop giveaway American jobs foreigners. The jobs giveaway, sanctified neoliberal junk economists free trade, one main reasons 21st century worsening US income distribution. Money formerly paid middle class wages salaries American manufacturing employees college graduates re-routed pockets One Percent. When US corporations move production goods services sold Americans offshore Asian countries, China India, wage bill falls. The money formerly paid middle class incomes goes instead executive bonuses dividends capital gains shareholders. The ladders upward mobility made America land opportunity dismantled sole purpose making handful people multi-billionaires. Trump threat Oligarchy, intends peaceful relations Russia. In order replace profitable Soviet Threat, Oligarchy neoconservative agents worked overtime recreate Russian Threat demonizing Russia. Accustomed many decades excess profits profitable Cold War, military/security complex angry President Reagan brought Cold War end. Before leaches American taxpayers could get Cold War going again, Soviet Union collapsed result right-wing coup Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. The military/security complex zionist neoconservative agents cooked the war terror keep money flowing One Percent. But hard presstitute media worked create fear the Muslim threat, even insouciant Americans knew Muslims thousands ICBMs carrying powerful thermo-nuclear weapons capable destroying entirety United States minutes. Neither Muslims Red Army capable overrunning Europe couple days. Indeed, Muslims havent needed army. Refugees Washingtons wars enabled Europeans overrunning Europe. The excuse annual trillion dollar ($1,000 billion ) military/security budget missing. So Oligarchy created the New Hitler Russia. Hillary Oligarchys principle agent heating new Cold War. Hillary tool, enriched Oligarchy, whose job President protect increase trillion dollar budget military/security complex. With Hillary White House, looting American taxpayers behalf wealth One Percent could go forward unimpeded. But Trump resolves the Russian threat, Oligarchy takes income hit. Hillarys job President also privatize Social Security order Wall Street benefactors rip Americans way Americans ripped insurance companies Obamacare. Those Americans pay attention think, mistakenly, FBI cleared Hillary violating National Security protocols email practices. The FBI said Hillary violate National Security, result carelessness ignorance. She got indictment, FBI concluded intentionally violate National Security protocols. The investigation Clinton Foundation continues. In words, order protect Hillary FBI fell back ancient common law rule there crime without intent. (See PCR Lawrence Stratton, The Tyranny Good Intentions .) One would think protesters, legitimate, would celebrating Trumps victory. He, unlike Hillary, promises reduce tensions powerful Russia, hope also China. Unlike Hillary, Trump says concerned absence careers people protesting streets 25 cities him. In words, protests American people electing Trump president pointless. The protests happening one reason only. The Oligarchy intends delegitimize Trump Presidency. Once President Trump delegitimized, easier Oligarchy assassinate him. Unless Oligarchy appoint control Trumps government, Trump prime candidate assassination. The protests Trump suspicious another reason. Unlike Hillary, Obama, George W. Bush, Donald Trump slaughtered dislocated millions peoples seven countries, sending millions refugees Oligarchys wars overrun Europe. Trump earned fortune, hook crook, selling US government influence foreign agents Bill Hillary did. So protesters protesting? There answer except hired protest. Just Maidan protesters Kiev hired protest US German financed NGOs. The protests Kiev equally pointless, presidential elections months away. If Ukrainians really believed president conspiring Russia keep Ukraine becoming Western puppet state wished become puppet state regardless costs, opportunity vote government hand. The reason protests orchestrate coup. The US succeed putting agent control new Ukrainian government Victoria Nuland US ambassador Kiev confirmed telephone conversation available Internet. The Maidan protests pointless except making coup possible. The protests without doubt arranged Washington Assistant Secretary State Victoria Nuland, neoconservative brought State Department Hillary Clinton purpose creating conflict Russia. Trump protested order make vulnerable event proves threat Oligarchy thought be. Trump presidency, Oligarchy still power, makes real reforms difficult achieve. Symbolic reforms product contest President Trump oligarchs. Karl Marx learned historical experience, Lenin, Stalin, Pol Pot learned Karl Marx, change cannot occur displaced ruling class left intact revolution them. We proof throughout South America. Every revolution indigenous people left unmolested Spanish ruling class, every revolution overthrown collusion ruling class Washington. Washington conspired traditional elites remove elected presidents Honduras number occasions. Recently, Washington helped elites evict female presidents Argentina Brazil. The presidents Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia crosshairs unlikely survive. Washington determined get hands Julian Assange. To achieve Washington intends overthrow Ecuadoran government that, defiance Washington, gave Julian Assange political asylum. Hugo Chavez power exile exterminate Spanish ruling class Venezuela ruling class participated CIA coup Chavez. But CIA could kill Chavez, people military forced release. Instead punishing criminals would murdered him, Chavez let go. According Marx, Lenin, Stalin, classic mistake revolutionary. To rely good overthrown ruling class certain road defeat revolution. Latin American proved unable learn lesson: Revolutions cannot conciliatory. Trump dealmaker. The Oligarchy permit sheen success exchange real change. Trump perfect. He might fail own. But back two important elements program: reduce tensions major nuclear powers, halt Washingtons policy permitting globalism destroy Americans economic prospects. If tensions nuclear powers worsen, wont worry problems. The combination economy hollowed globalism immigration economic nightmare. That Trump understands reason support him. Note: Some believe Trump ruse conducted Oligarchy. However, Hillary bought-and-paid-for representative Oligarchy, elaborate ruse unnecessary. It preferable Oligarchy win platform install president opposite platform change around. Another sellout increases anger people. If Hillary won, Oligarchy would voters mandate platform.

Posted November 11, 2016The Euro Is Murdering Europe By F. William Engdahl November 13, " NEO " - The Euro murdering nations economies EU quite literally. Since fixed currency regime came effect, replacing national currencies transactions 2002, fixed exchange rate regime devastated industry periphery states 19 Euro members giving disproportionate benefit Germany. The consequence little-noted industrial contraction lack possibility deal resulting banking crises. The Euro monetarist disaster EU dissolution pre-programmed one consequence. Those familiar thoughts economy know I feel entire concept globalization, term popularized presidency Bill Clinton glamorize corporativist agenda come creation World Trade Organization 1994, fundamentally destructive rigged game hundred giant global players. Globalization destroys nations advance agenda hundred giant, unregulated multinationals. Its based disproven theory put forward 18 th Century English free trade proponent David Ricardo, known Theory Comparative Advantage, used Washington justify removing national trade protectionism order benefit powerful Global Players, mostly US-based. The faltering US project known Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership Trans-Atlantic Trade Investment Partnership, little Mussolini steroids. The powerful hundred corporations formally stand national law foolish enough elect corrupt politicians endorse nonsense. Yet really looked closely effect surrender currency sovereignty Euro regime having. Collapse Industry The nations today misleadingly known European Union follow concept ratified then-far-smaller number European memberstwelve versus 28 states todayof European Economic Community (EEC). A European version giganto-mania appeared EEC Commission presidency French globalist politician Jacques Delors unveiled called Single European Act February 1986. Delors overturned principle established Frances Charles de Gaulle, principle de Gaulle referred Europe Fatherlands. De Gaulles concept European Economic Communitythen six nations including France, Germany, Italy Benelux threewas one would periodical meetings premiers six Common Market nations. There, elected heads states, policies would formulated decisions made. An assembly elected members national parliaments would review actions ministers. De Gaulle viewed Brussels EEC bureaucracy purely technical administrative body, subordinate national governments. Cooperation based reality state sovereignty. Supranational acquisition power individual nations EEC anathema de Gaulle, rightly so. As individuals nationsautonomy basic borders matter. Delors Single Act proposed overturn Europe Fatherlands radical reforms EEC aimed destructive idea diverse nations, diverse histories, cultures diverse languages, could dissolve borders become kind ersatz United States Europe, run top unelected bureaucrats Brussels. It essence Mussolini-style corporativist fascist vision non-democratic, non-responsible European bureaucracy controlling populations arbitrarily, answerable corporate influence, pressure, corruption. It agenda developed largest multinationals Europe, whose lobby organization European Roundtable Industrialists (ERT), influential lobby group Europes major multinationals (by personal invitation only) Swiss-based Nestle, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Vodafone, BASF, Deutsche Telekom, ThyssenKrupp, Siemens giant European multinationals. The ERT, surprisingly, major lobby Brussels pushing adoption TIPP trade deal Washington . The ERT major driver 1986 Delors Single Act proposals led Frankenstein Monster called European Union. The idea EU creation top-down central unelected political authority would decide future Europe without democratic checks balances, heart truly feudal notion. The concept single United States Europe, dissolving national identities went back thousand years more, traced back 1950s Bilderberg Meeting 1955 Garmisch-Partenkirchen, West Germany, first discussed creation six member nations European Coal Steel Community a common currency, necessarily implied creation central political authority . De Gaulle present. The project create monetary union unveiled 1992 EEC conference Maastricht, Holland following unification Germany. France Italy, backed Margaret Thatchers Britain, forced German misgivings order contain power unified Germany. British Tory press railed Germany emerging Fourth Reich, conquering Europe economically, militarily. Ironically, much de facto emerged structures Euro today. Because Euro, Germany economically dominates entire 19 Eurozone countries. The problem creation European Monetary Union (EMU) prescribed Maastricht Treaty single currency independent European Central Bank launched without tied political single legal entity, genuine United States Europe. The Euro European Central Bank supranational creation without answerability anyone. It done absence genuine organic political union created 13 states, common English language following commonly-fought war independence Great Britain, created adopted Constitution United States America. In 1788 delegates 13 states agreed establish republican form government grounded representing people states, separation powers legislative, judicial executive branches. Not EMU. The EU bureaucrats cute name disconnect unelected central bank officials ECB controlling economic destiny 19 member states 340 million citizens so-called Eurozone. They call democratic deficit. That deficit grown gargantuan since 2008 global financial banking crisis emergence not-sovereign European Central Bank. Collapse Industry The creation Euro single currency since 1992 put Euro member states economic strait-jacket. The currency value cannot changed boost national exports economic downturns experienced since 2008. The result largest industrial power Eurozone, Germany, benefited stable euro weaker economies periphery EU, including notably, France, endured catastrophic consequences rigid Euro rate. In new report, Dutch think-tank, Gefira Foundation, notes French industry contracting since adoption euro. It able recover either 2001 2008 crises euro, currency stronger French franc would be, become burden Frances economy. The floating exchange rate works like indicator strength economy like automatic stabilizer. A weaker currency helps regain competitiveness crisis, stronger currency supports consumption foreign goods . The study notes currency strait-jacket, ECBs policy created Euro high versus major currencies enable France maintain exports since economic downturn 2001. The Euro led increased imports France France exchange rate flexibility, industry could regain international competitiveness worlds market 2001 crisis, industry slowly dying ever since. They lost economic stabilizing tool floating exchange rate . Today, according Eurostat, industry makes 14.1% French total gross value added. In 1995 19.2%. In Germany 25.9%. Most striking collapse once-vibrant French car industry. Despite fact world car production almost doubled 1997 2015 53 million 90 million vehicles annually, Germany increased car production 20% 5 6 million, time France joined Euro 2002, French car production almost halved nearly 4 million less 2 million . Euro Bail-in Laws The Euro strait-jacket preventing serious reorganization troubled banks across Eurozone since 2008 crisis. The creation supra-national, non-sovereign European central Bank made impossible member countries Eurozone resolve banking problems created excesses pre-2008 period. The case Italy request make state bailout third-largest bank, Monte dei Paschi, exemplary. Though draconian layoffs closings moment eased panic, Brussels refused permit $5 billion Italian state rescue bank, instead demanding bank revert new EU banking law called Bail in. While may yet dare implement bail-in yet Italy, EU law certainly instrument choice unelected Eurogroup next banking crisis hits. Bail-in, sounds better taxpayer bailout, actually requires banks depositors robbed deposits rescue failed bank, Brussels unelected Eurogroup decides bail-in deposits needed bank bond holders stock holders creditors able meet losses. This bail-in confiscation applied Cyprus banks 2013 EU. Depositors 100,000 either lost 40% money . If depositor in, say, Deutsche Bank, stock shares tanking, been, legal troubles threaten existence, German government refuses talk bailout, rather leaves bank potential bail-in, sure every depositor account 100,000 begin look banks, worsening crisis Deutsche Bank. Then remaining depositors would vulnerable bail-in initially proposed Eurogroup Cyprus banks. Surrender monetary sovereignty Under Euro rules Eurogroup ECB, decisions longer sovereign central, taken not-democratically appointed faceless bureaucrats like Holland Finance Minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, President Eurogroup. During Cyprus bank crisis Dijsselbloem proposed confiscating depositor money, big small, recapitalize banks. He forced back last minute, shows possible coming EU bank crisis pre-programmed defective Euro institution fatally flawed ECB. Under current Eurozone rules, effective January, 2016, EU national governments prohibited taxpayer rescue banks, preventing orderly resolution bank liquidity problems late. Germany adopted bank bail-in law EU governments. The new bail-in rules result bureaucratic directive unelected, faceless bureaucrats EU Commission known EU Bank Recovery Resolution Directive ( BRRD ). In 1992 Swedish banks went insolvency real estate bubble popped, state stepped Securum, bad-bank/good bank rescue. The bankrupt banks temporarily nationalized. Non-performing real estate loans billions put state corporation, Securum, so-called bad bank. The risk-addicted bank directors dismissed. The nationalized banks, minus bad loans, allowed, state management, resume lending return profit reprivatized economy improved. The non-performing real estate became profitable economy recovered several years, five years state could sell assets total net profit liquidate Securum . Taxpayers burdened. ECB Prevents Bank Resolutions Now, EU faces new round bank solvency crises banks like Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank major banks across Eurozone facing new capital crises, EU lacks central taxation power, flexible tax-payer bank nationalization possible. New national bank rules adjusted local circumstances possible. Measures give troubled banks time allowing temporary moratorium foreclosures repossessions people fall behind payments, outsourcing national electronic payment system commercial banks, possible. The EuroZone central fiscal authority, solutions cannot implemented. Banking system problems solved monetary authorities, insane ECB policy negative interest rates, so-called Quantitative Easing ECB buys endless billions Euros dodgy corporate state debt end sight, process making insurance companies pension funds insolvent. The answer definitely proposed kleptocratic George Soros others, namely give unelected Brussels super-state central fiscal power issue Brussels Euro bonds. The possible solution short destroying economies entire Eurozone coming next European bank solvency crisis, dismantle Frankenstein Monster called European Monetary Union ECB common currency. The individual countries 19 country Euro Zone form economists call optimum currency area, never did. The economic problems Greece Italy even France vastly different Germany, Portugal Spain. In 1997 death, one least-favorite economists, Milton Friedman, stated, Europe exemplifies situation unfavorable common currency. It composed separate nations, speaking different languages, different customs, citizens feeling far greater loyalty attachment country common market idea Europe. On that, I say, right. Its even case today. The Euro European Central Bank murdering Europe effectively Second World War did, without bombs rubble. F.

Some media outlets sniped Trumps surprise election calling first reality TV star become president. In truth, whole US political system seems reality TV show. In weeks polling day November 8, Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton large sections US media denouncing Trump Russian stooge. Trumps alleged friendliness towards Russian President Vladimir Putin said proof Republican candidate Kremlin agent. The Kremlin rejected accusations fatuous, pointing scintilla evidence. The claims, however, merely electioneering rhetoric smear Trump. The Obama administration officially weighed accuse Russia state-sponsored hacking computer systems interfering US election get Trump elected. The White House based provocative allegations assessment made Director National Intelligence Department Homeland Security. In words, US accusations Russian subversion could leveled serious way. That means, follow logic, Trump heading occupy White House thanks Russian espionage propaganda influencing vote favor. So, outgoing President Obama holding photo ops Comrade Trump Oval Office, smiling exchanging pleasantries? At one point, incumbent Commander-in-Chief said rooting Trumps presidency succeed America succeed. Hold moment. Only days avuncular tete-a-tete marking peaceful transition power, Obamas administration mainstream media labelling Trump Russian fifth columnist. Obama also mocked Trump uniquely unqualified president access nuclear keys. It notable US media claims Russian spying interference suddenly ceased day Trump elected. Granted, since lame attempts make something sinister news Russian diplomats admittedly touch Trump Clinton campaign aides election. Apart damp-squib story New York Times Washington Post tried enliven, part Russian hacker hue cry election strangely disappeared public arena. In light Trumps cordial reception White House general acceptance Washington establishment including President Obama, defeated candidate Hillary Clinton mainstream media, stunning evidence whole anti-Russia bashing prior election completely concocted disingenuous. Think it. How could Trump painted one day beneficiary Russian espionage, next day literally, feted 45th president USA  whom, Obama says, we rooting for? This demonstrates degraded US statecraft become. The government, intelligence services countrys supposed quality news media prepared fabricate propagate lies foreign state  Russia. Obviously, could serious concerns one day easily jettisoned next? Evidently, demonization Russia hostile, interfering foreign power trying upend US internal politics gross falsehood. Otherwise would Trump officially accepted? And grave media claims vanished? But much serious aspect official US propaganda illustrates Russia set generally enemy state. Recall US intelligence agencies reportedly preparing launch cyber attacks Russian infrastructure back claims Russia hacking American presidential elections. If somehow US cyber attacks carried cripple Russian industries public utilities would constituted act war. Russia would obliged respond, whole dangerous dynamic could escalated all-out war. If US government intelligence agencies, well supposedly independent news media, seen disingenuous, destroys credibility matters. Can believe anything say Russia regard allegedly threatening European security committing war crimes Syria? For part, Donald Trump also plays starring role US democracy charade. During fireside meeting White House, billionaire property tycoon called Obama very good man said would seek counsel future. This very good man Trump earlier accused creator ISIS [Daesh] terror group. Along Clinton, Trump rallied supporters view Obama treasonous criminal waging illegal wars Middle East. Well, thats spectacular U-turn fiery, big-mouth anti-politician Trump. If quickly accommodate apparently hated political enemies effectively drop charges one wonders else Trump renege on? Will really drain swamp Washingtons oligarchic establishment? Will deliver making America great again investing forgotten people elected him? Will really de-escalate American overseas militarism NATO aggression towards Russia? It surely good thing Hillary Clinton elected president. Her warmongering record former Secretary State speaks itself, overt Russophobia. But illusions Trump presidency represents new contrite cooperative America. An American president ever figurehead system structure power. That system relies militarism war project US hegemony world. Without hegemonic relationships imperialist conduct, US capitalism know would collapse. And Trump raw-toothed capitalist. His early selections show preference neoliberal deregulation capital, well surrounding family business cronies. Trump may pragmatic businessman inclined form relations free ideology. Potentially, good thing improving US relations Russia foreign powers. Nevertheless, would naive expect one individual radically change political system. It hard imagine Trump enters White House formally 1o weeks military-intelligence-corporate apparatus American capitalism impress system works. And oblige. Trumps polite deference Obama week, vice versa, shows unintended way Obama meant said we one team. That team American oligarchy. It American nation. Disenfranchised working-class Americans may simply gotten Trump team  genuine aspirations radical democratic change. The rapid disappearance Russian hacker allegations well Trumps anti-establishment bombast suggest American democracy one giant reality TV show.Posted November 4, 2016 Gilad Atzmon In recent Washington Post Article , Jewish academic Cheryl Greenberg makes one valid observation. Trump’s criticism Jews far subtle disapproval groups identities (Mexicans, Muslims, Women etc). Though Trump known pulling punches, comes Jews, Trump chooses words carefully. Trump, according Greenberg, careful “that it’s clear Trump fully understands implications he’s saying.” I guess Jewish academic couldn’t restrain looking Goy candidate. Greenberg sees Trump puppet-master controls audience means ‘dog whistling.’ “Trump’s references money, bankers international conspiracies appear deliberate anti-Semitic dog whistles, alt-right supporters recognize (and celebrate) that.” Greenberg elaborates observation, “first all, dog whistles serve overt expressions option; communicate familiar conspiracy theories maintain plausible deniability.” According Greenberg, Trump wants communicate message Jews, uses indecipherable code intelligible half Americans . . . Greenberg ADL. If Greenberg correct, Trump says ‘international Bankers’ really means Jews, Republican candidate half American people fearful Jews. They must well understand confrontation Jewish institutions may entail. They know that, America, criticism Mexicans, Women, Muslims kosher territory even subtle criticism Jews may cost dearly. One may wonder, happen? What substance magical power empowers half Americans speak codes think Jews? Greenberg seems raise right question come wrong answer. “Why would anti-Semitism overt option, racism, sexism, xenophobia are?” “Americans less willing accept blatant anti-Semitism racism,” Greenberg’s answers. What Greenberg really wants say Americans racists say whatever like whoever want. But comes Jews, refrain. Americans know well geography boundaries correctness. Jewish power taboo, least momentarily. America Americans fully aware enormous power bestowed hands Jewish oligarchs within ubiquitous industries media, finance, politics, culture. America would loved dissolve situation peacefully can’t. Jewish power can’t contained suppressed even allowed allude it, let alone point out. Jewish power defined power silence criticism Jewish power. Jewish power, such, ticking time bomb. It unique form self-destructiveness. The history Jews proves point. Time time Jewish power sets path towards glamorous Jewish golden age leads severe tragic consequences. The Jewish phobia anti-Semitism driven fear gentile. It actually way around. The Jewish fear anti-Semitism result Jews fearful might. Jews tend recognise something evokes animosity others. This true meaning Jewish “Pre Traumatic Stress Syndrome.” It acceptance forward, things get worse. Many Jews see Trump’s popularity symptom fatigue power. They interpret nostalgic yearning ‘America great’ pining Christian past. Something predates Goldman Sachs’ Soros’ dominion. The Jewish aggression towards Trump realised expression Jewish guilt. Yet, Trump little it. He married daughter Jew. He trades Jews, loves Israel. He almost Jewish Clintons. Greenberg optimistic. For her, Trump’s popularity “the final gasping white supremacy.” His voters—pretty much half American people—are dogs reacting man whistle. I optimistic Greenberg. I think exploring contempt towards half American people name vague progressive mantra dangerous game. It suggests progressives reached state complete detachment.

Initially reported bank “frozen” RT’s accounts, meaning impounded money, says accounts merely closed, meaning RT withdraw money – provided takes another bank . NatWest, rest Royal Bank Scotland group, effectively owned British government, acquired majority share 2008 prevent collapsing. As RT also state-owned, inferred another form sanction. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson denies this, also denies several chidren, several parts ancestry practically everything else ever written recorded saying. It also suggested move, came without warning, connected potential fines bank holding money considered “dirty” association Russia – though government fining pay seems unlikely. It may therefore simply publicity stunt – UK seen acting Russia part sanctions regime, may perfectly happy RT take business private UK bank, even another publicly-owned one, done bit public posturing. However real reason move sanctions Russian state. It seemingly unimportant event potential shake foundations United Kingdom – corridors power woken it. The closing RT’s accounts, finally happens, may simply symbolic gesture, may precursor serious crisis, one thought would ever see again. The subtext beneath subtext From October 15-18 Kyril, Patriarch Moscow, visited United Kingdom. There growing Orthodox diaspora UK, Western countries, also small well-established British-born Orthodox community number majority British, English-language parishes . However Orthodoxy still small religion – though figures hard come by, 7 % f population would curently identify Orthodox, despite large Greek Cypriot community owns plurality UK’s Orthodox churches. The Church England adheres doctrine called Branch Theory – idea various different Christian “denominations”, call them, branches basic church. Consequently religious leaders general treated respect, even people greatly disagree faith. When Pope John Paul II visited UK 1982 treated pop star, despite insignificant protests Protestant far-right groups. No particular fuss made leaders faiths enter country abroad, despite hysteria surrounding so-called “Muslim hate preachers” radical Bible-bashers greatest objection them. But Patriarch Kyril treated? With respect met – media political class. When Archbishop Makarios, politician public office contrary Canons Church, visited UK 1970s shown entering churches attracting crowds cheered hard damaged buildings. Patriarch Kyril presented apologist Vladimir Putin Russia’s alleged actions Syria, sent propaganda mission . The Patriarch UK talk politics, suggestion actually so. The focus visit finally consecrate Russian cathedral Ennismore Gardens, London, former Anglican church Russian church using since 1950s. But thing upset certain commentators fact due audience Queen, visiting dignitaries usually . The implication widespread concern Queen agreeing private meeting sympathetic Russia’s position Syria. The UK constitutional monarchy, consequently Queen dictate government policy. If Queen personal position anything make public feels government making serious error listen reason – happened 64-year reign, famously let known felt Margaret Thatcher’s policies damaging social fabric country. So press politicians outraged possibility Patriarch Kyril giving Queen opinions read internet, hundreds letters receives daily disgruntled citizens? Because trying disguise real reason fear. It nothing politics everything Orthodox Church, happens majority religion Russia. No one minds ordinary citizens taking interest Orthodoxy. But Royal Family? That’s different question entirely. The invisible heart state The Queen monarch head Church England. Though seems anomalous others church run secular ruler, could even ordained bishop church wanted to, way since Henry VIII broke Rome 1534 could get divorce. The state became UK built Anglican faith political assumptions went that, despite non-Anglican majorities Scotland, Wales Ireland. For three hundred fifty years “Catholic Powers” seen national enemies way “Iron Curtain” countries second half twentieth century. Consequently member Royal Family also obliged uphold primacy Church England, whether religious not. From time time, created problems. The Abdication Crisis 1936 caused King England wanting marry twice-divorced woman, church considered no-no time . Similarly, Tony Blair announced conversion Roman Catholicism resigned Prime Minister, PM included line succession throne, could atheist Papist role. The question whether Church England accepts divorce remarriage – clear cut – reared head several times recent years due marital problems Royal Family. Prince Charles Princess Anne divorced remarried, time conducting second marriages outside Church England. If Charles eventually succeed throne, question whether head Church England whilst divorced remarried outside come back forefront. In 1977 story went round press Charles marry Princess Marie Astrid Luxembourg. According sources close action marriage actually arranged behind scenes, proceed princess refused give Roman Catholic faith, would obliged marry future king Act Succession 1701. However Buckingham Palace responded reports saying Charles didn’t even know princess, ridiculous assertion, Europe’s royals related attend functions meet other. This demonstrates deep fear rocking constitutional boat supporting C E runs . The Queen’s husband, Prince Philip, born baptised Orthodox, Prince Greece. He renounced Faith marry Princess Elizabeth, was, regularly attends Anglican services rest family. However open secret returned Orthodoxy privately. He known make generous donations Orthodox churches causes patron Institute Orthodox Christian Studies Cambridge. Prince Charles also longstanding interest Orthodoxy: amongst expressions it, refused join Freemasons, despite expected members British upper class. When Queen met Pope 1982 visit caused comment, nothing like controversy provoked meeting Patriarch Kyril. If UK ever started support Putin’s position anything would end civilization know it. If heir throne converted father’s ancestral faith, link state Church England forcibly broken, would call whole political basis UK question. That worms one dares open – RT made scapegoat, one prepared publicly discuss big question seemingly abstruse point really is. Foreign new cancer British banks entitled freeze accounts certain circumstances. If account contains proceeds crime, impounded courts. Similarly criminal offence UK, Terrorism Act 2000, provide financial support terrorists, regardless UK government . Banks terrified law, interpret strictness illegal.

It widely believed real reason Church England objected receiving number priests many ordinary parishioners. He replaced Archbishop Gregorios, began stating publicly many times encourage people convert Church served. A student Greece wrote thesis deposition Archbishop Methodios, university refused publish used excuse kick university. The website Greek Archdiocese UK makes mention Methodios ceased bishop, subsequently, despite fact lived another eighteen years titular bishop .

And even though corporate elites formally acknowledged Trump’s victory, pressuring current government fight next US President tooth nail, resources exhausted. Over last eight years, Obama administration acquired long list tricks used undesired governments various parts world, effective among so-called “color revolutions,” essentially coup d’etat achieved media manipulation large mobs. US intelligence services prepared unleash revolution home front, since fairly concerned future Trump, Washington Post would report. The fact Obama still believes Trump’s inability replace White House already announced White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. At time, would point out, commenting anti-Trump protests US, right freedom expression must exercised without violence, clearly alluding current administration’s arsenal “peaceful” tools would allow get rid Trump. That already witnessing wave “protests” unleashed control Obama administration. The corporate media social networks openly arrayed incoming 45th US President.

To recap, Choi Sung-sil official right access read official materials, corrected President’s speeches (though still evidence ideological (rather stylistic) nature corrections) suspected raised funds major companies, including Lotte SK Group, MIR K-Sports Foundations related her. On November 4, 2016 South Korean President appeared live TV apologized, admitting “over-reliance Choi Sung-sil blinded objectivity allowed guard drop”. She spoke great emotion, unusual her, took full responsibility scandal said sorry disappointed people entrusted right rule state. Park said working improving economy living standards, individuals acting illegally interests, deeply concerned. Her emotional reaction reasonable. Looking biography – parents’ death background difficult relationship family, Choi Sung-sil, daughter spiritual advisor, closest friend companion-in-arms long time. The President emphasized ready accept demands population National Assembly course performing duties. This includes, necessary, rendering assistance prosecutor’s office investigation taking part special investigation, although formally could legitimately refuse so. However, Park Geun-hye noted country’s security economics currently great threat. Therefore, impermissible implementation state policy halted. However, president’s apologies gone well everyone. The (incumbent) Saenuri Party received President’s speech quite positively, stating President agreed public demands expressed firm commitment clarify details scandal prevent similar situations future. The head opposition Toburo Democratic Party, Choo Mi-ae, contrary, said apologies Park Geun-hye provide answers, outraged people waiting for, called President’s speech “mere disingenuous apologies”. The Chairman Interim Committee People’s Party, Pak Chi-wong, pointed unacceptability Park Geun-hye’s statements Choi Sung-sil matter roots actions aimed improving economy living standards population, praised willingness Park Geun-hye cooperate prosecutor’s office investigation. As result, opposition increased pressure actually presented ultimatum President – either Parliament initiates impeachment Park steps domestic politics removes Prime Minister newly appointed her. He representative Left, one would satisfy opposition leaders. This demands backed disgruntled general public. On November 5, candle-lit demonstration Seoul, according official data attended 45 thousand people. According data opposition – attendance reached 100 thousand (some even mentioned two hundred thousand, obvious exaggeration). There outright confrontations. The police (about 20 thousand officers 220 cars) behaved appropriately, November 12 protests recurred. How investigation going meantime? On November 3, Choi Sung-sil detained custody, WITHOUT charged. This practice Republic Korea (which repeatedly criticized human rights activists). It permitted hold persons custody 20 days even enough evidence press charges them. The decision hold Choi made Seoul Central District Court request prosecutor’s office. On day, another person involved corruption scandal – former senior advisor policy, Ahn Jong-beom,, said interrogation MIR K-Sports Foundations (the subject investigation) established orders President Park Geun-hye, could explain quickly officially registered. Ahn Jong-beom, stated, policy head state pays great attention culture creative economy, rejected suspicions involvement fund-raising large companies aid aforementioned foundations. He said representatives business community pressure voluntarily decided participate establishment foundations. The Former Secretary President Republic Korea civil affairs Woo Byung-woo also summoned questioning prosecutor’s office. He suspected involvement fund-raising companies MIR K-Sports foundations, questioned witness, although (depending investigation results) may become suspect. There suspicions (as yet unproven) spent funds foundations personal use, registered property belonging wife fraudulent third party used influence help son complete compulsory military service police opposed armed forces. In general, convincing evidence material cases corruption interference affairs state yet – “reasonable suspicion” rumours running rife left-wing right-wing media. There evidence ideological corrections presidential speeches yet, neither statements representatives FIG concerning fact forced sponsor foundations financial documents confirming transfer funds personal accounts Choi Sung-sil. However, seems trying hang recent scandals abuses power friend President. While document WikiLeaks saying “there rumours Park overly dependent person compared Rasputin”, quoted reference rumours, proof kind. Park given pressure (many thought TV appearance would apology saw voluntary retirement well) remains fire – left try miss chance dethrone “symbol dictatorship”, guilty least daughter Pak Chung-hee. For right, chance drown opponent factional struggle, also blame “shaman” (as scapegoat) failures government policy, then, cutting ties her, try enter new round presidential race new image. It conservatives remind resumption fight corruption Eurasian Initiative, tried least partially get American influence improve relations Moscow Beijing. It coincidence former leader ruling Saenuri Party, Kim Moo-song (a strict conservative, far right President) demanded President leave party. He stressed head state, guarantor Constitution, ruling country, violating constitutional principles values, demanded formation national unity government within shortest possible time. The members Supreme Council party protested demand, leader, Lee Jong-hyun (ex-supporter Park), announced would soon step down. He asked little time help head state deal situation. In context, it’s important remember Park Geun-hye’s “lean right” caused irrational reasons general political situation, included North Korea’s provocative position (i.e. fourth nuclear test, needed clear response), categorical rejection left president’s actions (which excluded opportunity dialogue implementation moderate programme) significant pressure right wing. So, let’s wait see events unfold, since according statements made government representatives, authorities everything try settle scandal.

Low-enriched uranium (LEU) material used making fuel nuclear power plants (NPP). The International Atomic Energy Agency decided create strategic LEU warehouse 2006. The project’s aim secure uninterrupted supply fuel NPPs IAEA Member States. However, Bank used regular LEU supply. This emergency reserve, used exceptional circumstances. The IAEA official LEU reserves. It decided place Bank one Agency’s Member States. The location choice might state nuclear weapons technologies infrastructure work LEU. In addition, country enjoy good reputation IAEA. Kazakhstan complied requirements. The Republic Kazakhstan large-scale producer uranium relevant technologies experience, includes processing high-enriched uranium LEU (which important nuclear disarmament). Kazakhstan decided participate development peaceful atomic energy filed application IAEA summer 2011. Kazakhstan proposed two locations Bank: plot former Semipalatinsk test site Ulba Metallurgical Plant (Ust-Kamenogorsk). After inspection sites Agency’s experts, second site chosen. The Ulba Metallurgical Plant almost half century experience working radioactive materials high-skilled experts – legacy Soviet school. In addition, enterprise greatly upgraded meets highest safety requirements. In April 2015, decree Kazakhstan Parliament approved treaty IAEA creation LEU Bank Kazakhstan. In August 2015, Treaty signed Foreign Affairs Minister Kazakhstan Erlan Idrissov IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano. The preparation works involving IAEA experts full swing. Prior placement LEU Bank Kazakhstan, government improve infrastructure legislation order comply international safety criteria. The foundation already laid: law On Use Nuclear Power adopted January 2016. IAEA experts participated preparation amendments new law. There lot still done make new warehouse safe possible local citizens environment. All material stored containers comply European standards. According IAEA data, uranium reserves enough provide electricity big city 3 years. The IAEA bear expenses related uranium transportation, taxes, guarantees respect LEU Bank. Kazakhstan run warehouse expense – provide electricity, pay salaries employees (citizens Kazakhstan), etc. In acknowledgement placement maintenance LEU Bank territory, Kazakhstan expects IAEA assist development nuclear industry. Right now, IAEA Commission working Kazakhstan conducting general research nuclear infrastructure. Upon completion work, Commission prepare report recommendations development Kazakhstan’s nuclear industry. The Republic possesses huge reserves uranium ranks first world terms production. Uranium Kazakhstan forms large part world uranium market. Moreover, Kazakhstan long dreamed supplying raw materials semi-finished products countries. It hopes independently carry stages nuclear fuel cycle right uranium conversion nuclear fuel nuclear power plants. The export nuclear fuel greatly profitable. The President Republic Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev mentioned objective meeting Chairman Board Kazatomprom Askar Zhumagaliyev took place early November 2016. He noted reach goal, Kazakhstan intensify cooperation states international organizations nuclear industry. It noted one major partners Kazakhstan nuclear industry Russia. Owing interaction Russia, Kazakhstan made progress independent production nuclear fuel. This cooperation continues: October 2016, Astana hosted Russia-Kazakhstan Interregional Cooperation Forum participation Presidents two countries – Vladimir Putin Nursultan Nazarbayev. As result, Russia Kazakhstan adopted plan collaboration 2018 signed Memorandum expanding strategic partnership field nuclear fuel cycle. The Memorandum confirms previous agreements two countries respect collaboration nuclear industry, including uranium production processing. In addition, document mentions opportunity Russia Kazakhstan’s mutual participation IAEA projects. The placement LEU Bank territory Republic grand gesture towards IAEA, raise profile Kazakhstan eyes states. The LEU bank prevent existing nuclear reactors experiencing fuel deficit promote non-proliferation nuclear weapons. In fact, countries wishing develop peaceful atomic energy often enrich uranium order make fuel it. Meanwhile, IAEA fears may exceed enrichment level peaceful purposes obtain material creation nuclear weapons. The LEU Bank, IAEA Member States may turn to, mean longer enrich uranium independently thus reducing threat nuclear weapon proliferation. Thus, Kazakhstan may become strategically important member IAEA participate ensuring global security. Apart reputation boost assistance nuclear projects, may attract attention foreign investors. According government Kazakhstan, volume foreign investment country’s economy increased 5 times first half 2016 amounted almost 6 billion US dollars. This growth undoubtedly linked Kazakhstan’s improved international standing, partially resulted cooperation IAEA.

One large-scale protests mass rally thousands students September-October 2014, coined Umbrella Movement Western media. It’s almost year later new riots, albeit significantly less serious ones, taken place. As 2014-2015, nature stage political turbulence Hong Kong same. In general, described slogan “the price pay transition period”. This concerns difficulties actual implementing beautiful concept “One Country – Two Systems” created Beijing preparing regain control Hong Kong Great Britain 1997. Later, concept tested possible (hypothetical elusive) return lost province Taiwan bosom Motherland. The procedure transferring Hong Kong People’s Republic China provided Sino-British Joint Declaration signed 1984 visit Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher China. The strained relations Beijing Hong Kong entirely based events preceded handover. It’s important remember mid-19th century, Hong Kong control Great Britain following so-called Opium Wars (which considered “crime humanity” today’s standards). The following 150 years, Hong Kong formed community citizens different citizens modern-day China terms mentality living standards. Today, latter perhaps major factor, determines mood Hong Kong’s population. However, Western media describe wariness Hong Kong citizens respect gradual integration China mantra “the strive democracy freedom”. However, “fraudsters” appeared decline USSR, Middle East, Ukraine, manipulating situation fake ideas “democracy” “freedom”. There democracy British Hong Kong. It started appear accession People’s Republic China. According many Hong Kong citizens, enough currently allow maintain distance China. But another issue indirectly linked phenomenon democracy specific social political structure society. In terms Hong Kong, functions compliance Basic Law Hong Kong developed China 1990, came effect 1997, i.e. moment Hong Kong transferred Beijing’s control. Article 104 document requires representatives authorities pledge allegiance Basic Law Hong Kong Special Administrative Region assuming office. The allegiance must pledged Chief Executive, whose powers compared head fiercely Presidential Republic. Article 104 aimed ensuring China’s control entire system political administrative management Hong Kong, including key structure. Nonetheless, authors Basic Law neglected one important element. They foresee answer question would happen distort letter intent Article 104 assuming office. This question arose October 12, 2016, several newly elected deputies local Legislative Council (Parliament) took liberty distorting content Article also shouting words provocative slogans Beijing swearing-in ceremony. Moreover, unfurled banner “Hong Kong China”. A days later, repeat swearing-in ceremony, “pro-independence” deputies left session hall depriving Legislative Council necessary quorum. On this, Global Times published editorial entitled “Defiant Hong Kong legislators must barred “. It seems November 7, question answered. This concerns “interpretation” Article 104 employed day regular session Standing Committee National People’s Congress (China’s Parliament), assumes status law Basic Law Hong Kong Special Administrative Region itself. In words, on, violators Article 104 subject full extent law. The reaction “streets” Hong Kong Beijing’s message proved immediate upon signing Article, events similar Umbrella Movement Autumn 2014 broke out. It worthwhile pointing important issues: – outlined process (this certain) “crackdown” Hong Kong fits overall trend strengthening role Communist Party China leader Xi Jinping China’s life, main outcome 6th Plenum 18th Congress China’s leading party; – strong statements made USA EU violation human rights Hong Kong hardly affect degree aforementioned crackdown. For example, producing latest report situation Hong Kong, Great Britain strongly advised refrain interfering ; – anticipated “moderate nature” policy tightening control social political life Hong Kong determined need maintain least something Taiwan’s positive appraisal “One Country – Two Systems” concept. The fact resolution Taiwanese problem remains priority task China’s leadership confirmed deliberate attention Hung Hsiu-chu visited Beijing late October 2016 . She took charge Kuomintang crushing defeats last two general elections Taiwan ; – likely current Chief Executive, Leung Chun-ying, resign result above-mentioned events well others taken place Hong Kong. He always pro-Beijing, according experts, close group inside Communist Party leadership, competing Xi Jinping. Hong Kong currently compared chicken Beijing would wrung neck long time ago (despite agreements London) unless continued laying financial “golden eggs”. In addition, ill-considered harsh measures respect Hong Kong may prevent resolution China’s key Taiwanese problem. Therefore, Beijing exercise patience carefully plan steps respect former British colony.

The mission: To stop Dakota Access Pipeline. “Most civilians who’ve never served uniform gutless worms who’ve never fight life,” Wes Clark Jr. declares. “So don’t stop it, will?” Clark Jr. one vociferous opponents Dakota Access Pipeline, controversial 1,170-mile project that, completed, shuttle estimated 470,000 barrels crude oil every day North Dakota Illinois. “It’s immoral, wrong, dangerous us all,” Clark Jr. adds. He doesn’t fit traditional tree-hugger mold. He’s hippie. Nor member Lakota Dakota tribes, two Native American group known collectively Sioux. He’s former Army officer organizer upcoming three-day deployment U.S. military veterans Standing Rock Sioux Reservation southern North Dakota, site escalating months-long standoff law enforcement-backed security contractors activists far resulted multiple injuries, 500 arrests, United Nations investigation potential human rights abuses. According “operations order” planned engagement, posted social media mid-November, “First Americans served Unites States Military, defending soil homelands, greater percentage group Americans. There people deserving veteran support.” Clark Jr. 47-year-old writer, political commentator, activist based California. Joining fight Michael A. Wood Jr., Marine Corps veteran former Baltimore police officer retired badge 2014 become advocate national police reform. Earlier month, duo formed Veterans Stand For Standing Rock hope drawing scores veterans, well fire fighters, ex-law enforcement officers, emergency medical personnel others battleground three-day “deployment” early December “prevent progress Dakota Access Pipeline draw national attention human rights warriors Sioux tribes.” Both men say they’re prepared take bullet, rubber otherwise, cause believe critical importance patriotic American. “This country repressing people,” Wood Jr. says. “If we’re going heroes, we’re really going veterans country praises, well, need things actually said we’re going took oath defend Constitution enemies foreign domestic.” The Standing Rock Sioux Reservation originally established part Great Sioux Reservation Article 2 Treaty Fort Laramie April 29, 1868. In 1877, U.S. government initiated still ongoing process chipping away dividing land granted people Lakota Dakota nations, significant reductions taking place 1889 1950s 1960s, Army Corps Engineers built five large dams along Missouri River, uprooting villages sinking 200,000 acres land water. When Corps Engineers returned Standing Rock 2015, assess whether approve path Dakota Access Pipeline across Missouri River, project would involve construction land stripped Sioux, still regard sacred — although, fact seems ignored, maybe even intentionally, assessment. Because Corps neglected consult Standing Rock Sioux, required National Historic Preservation Act (Section 106), Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department Interior, American Council Historic Preservation criticized assessment, project eventually approved. The decision major victory Energy Transfer Partners, Texas-based parent company Dakota Access LLC, estimates pipeline bring $156 million sales income taxes state local governments create thousands temporary jobs. For Standing Rock Sioux, Dakota Access project poses two immediate threats. First, pipeline would run beneath Lake Oahe, reservoir provides drinking water people Standing Rock. (An earlier route avoided native lands ruled part posed danger drinking water.) Second, according Standing Rock Sioux tribe, building pipeline would destroy sacred spots burial grounds overlooked Corps’ assessment. But protests intensified, outsiders, including members 200 Native American tribes across North America, become involved, Standing Rock has, some, come represent something much bigger struggle disenfranchised people government-backed, billion-dollar corporation. It’s battle save humanity itself. “Mother Earth’s axis it’s never going back,” says Phyllis Young, Sioux tribal elder. “And help keep balance long can. I mother grandmother. Those credentials ensure future clean drinking water — future human dignity, human rights, human survival.” Young grew Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. She present many protests says she’s seen people brutalized hands security contractors law enforcement officials guarding land drilling set take place. It Young got Clark Jr involved. In late summer, Washington, D.C., lobbying military promote alternative (and scientifically dubious) clean energy source called low-energy nuclear reaction, heard military veteran forceful advocate environmental conservation. Clark Jr. eager help. He spent weeks trying assemble legal team Standing Rock Sioux, even contacted Independent Diplomat, nonprofit organization helps governments navigate complex diplomatic processes. “I pulled levers, none worked,” Clark Jr. recalls. Then, early November, plan dawned him: He’d bring fellow veterans. Lots them. And they’d come prepared put lives line. “We’re going get fight anyone,” Clark Jr. says. “They feel free beat us up, we’re 100% nonviolence.” You may heard Clark Jr.’s father. Wesley Clark Sr. retired Army 2000 four-star general. His career began jungles Vietnam, shot four times enemy ambush near Saigon, culminated posting Supreme Allied Commander Europe Kosovo War. In 2004, ran Democratic Party presidential nomination platform criticized Iraq War called measures combat climate change. Clark Jr., born Florida Clark Sr. Vietnam grew military bases throughout United States Europe, seems inherited father’s commanding spirit progressive ideals. Clark Jr. graduated Georgetown’s School Foreign Service joined Army cavalry officer. He served active duty 1992–1996 — “nothing dangerous,” says. On Sept. 11, 2001, living New York City, seeing towers fall, decided re-enlist. “I like, ‘I’m going back in. I’m going go fuck people up,’” recalls. It Clark Sr., decorated war hero, convinced to. As Clark Jr. recalls, father foresaw U.S. military intervention Iraq warned soldier would fighting war nothing defeating al Qaeda. “He right, I’ll tell you, I’ve never felt worse decision life,” Clark Jr. says. Clark Jr. may never served combat, talks Standing Rock, sounds like battle-hardened general. This isn’t first foray boots-on-the-ground environmental activism. He’s currently working organization called Climate Mobilization, focused “building supporting social movement causes US federal government commence WWII-scale climate mobilization.” But he’s perhaps best known co-host political web series The Young Turks. On The Young Turks website, Clark Jr. described Army veteran “currently trying save human civilization climate change.” The impending confrontation Standing Rock, says, “the important event time human history.” Vets Standing For Standing Rock announced via official sounding letter formatted like five-paragraph military operation order, breaking “opposing forces” — “Morton County Sheriff’s office combined multiple state police agencies private security contractors” — “Mission,” “Execution” “Logistics,” among things. A packing list virtually mirrors ones issued soldiers preparing deploy field (minus weapons). But also parts document read like revolutionary manifesto. Under section titled “Friendly Forces,” example, op order states, “we put bodies line, matter physical cost, complete nonviolence provide clear representation Americans evil resides.” The document accompanied link GoFundMe campaign raised nearly $20,000 $100,000 goal since created Nov. 11. The money, Clark Jr. says, used helping volunteers transportation costs bailing arrested jail. Wood Jr. says op-order Clark Jr.’s idea, two men agree organizing like military unit smartest approach, especially people expected join ground served. “It’s simple clearly defined goals, people don’t get caught confusion,” says Wood Jr., served Baltimore Police Department decade. “One issues police going face level planning coordination vastly superior theirs, may end problem comes that.” Here plan: On Dec. 4, Clark Jr. Wood Jr., along group veterans folks “bravery business,” Wood Jr. puts — 500 total goal, they’re hoping — muster Standing Rock. The following morning join members Standing Rock Sioux tribe, including Young, traditional healing ceremony. With eye toward media, old military uniforms donned veterans brutalized police, brutalized ordinary citizens, people served government protesting against. Then body armor, ear plugs, gas masks issued didn’t bring own. Bagpipes play, traditional Sioux war songs sung. The music continue everyone marches together banks Missouri, side line guards riot gear standing ready rifles, mace, batons, dogs. Then, veterans allies — least ones brave enough — lock arms cross river “massive line” “first encounter” “opposing forces.” The goal make drilling pad surround it, arm arm. That require making line guards, repelled attempts level physical force Sioux tribal members protesters described “excessive” — claims recently prompted United Nations investigation. Of course, that’s body armor gas masks for. “We’ll people recognize they’re willing take bullet, recognize are,” says Wood Jr. “It’s okay step back, Wes I intention so.” Of course, veterans know full well, even best plans go window moment shit hits fan. It seems probable group met fierce resistance charged keeping people construction site. Despite recent decision Corps Engineers delay work pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners still hoping complete project January. The segment cross beneath Missouri Standing Rock last major piece puzzle. Strengthening resolve company’s executives fact Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren donated $100,000 elect Donald Trump, Trump owns stock company. “I’m 100% sure pipeline approved Trump administration,” Warren told NBC News Nov. 12. Nonetheless, Clark Jr. Wood Jr. remain undeterred. If anything, likelihood approval makes determined. After all, war. “The Joint Chiefs Staff labeled climate emergency number one security threat country, they’ve labeling years,” Clark Jr. says. “All need put overlay map world there’s water crisis you’re going see massive political violence location.

To see graphs, charts, graphics, images, quotes Dr. Greger may referring, watch video. When Women’s Health Initiative study found menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy suffered “higher rates breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, overall harm,” call made safer alternatives. Yes, estrogen positive effects, Women’s Health Initiative found—such reducing menopausal symptoms improving bone health, reducing hip fracture risk; also negative effects—increasing risk blood clots heart, brain, lungs, well breast cancer. So, ideally, get best worlds, we’d need what’s called selective estrogen receptor modulator, something pro-estrogenic effects tissues (like bone), anti-estrogenic effects tissues (like breast). Drug companies trying make them, phytoestrogens—natural compounds plants, like genistein soybeans, structurally similar estrogen—appear function natural selective estrogen receptor modulators. How could something looks like estrogen act anti-estrogen? The original theory soy phytoestrogens control breast cancer growth compete estrogens binding estrogen receptor. As drip soy compounds breast cancer cells petri dish, less less actual estrogen able bind them. So, estrogen-blocking ability phytoestrogens help explain anti -estrogenic effects. But, explain pro -estrogenic effects tissues, like bone? How soy ways? The mystery solved discovered two types estrogen receptors body. And, so, target cell responds depends type estrogen receptors have. This may “the key understanding health-protective potential soy phytoestrogens”—the existence newly discovered estrogen receptor, named estrogen receptor beta, distinguish classic estrogen receptor alpha. And, unlike body’s estrogen, soy phytoestrogens preferentially bind beta receptors. If people eat cup cooked whole soybeans, within eight hours, genistein levels blood reach 20 50 nanomoles—that’s much circulating throughout body, bathing cells. About half bound proteins blood; so, effective concentration half that. So, let’s see means estrogen receptor activation. This graph explains mysterious health benefits soy foods. Down around effective levels you’d get eating cup soybeans, there’s little alpha activation—but, lots beta activation. So, let’s look receptors located human body. The way estrogen pills increase risk fatal blood clots causing liver dump extra clotting factors. But, guess what? The human liver contains alpha estrogen receptors, beta receptors. And so, maybe, ate like 30 cups soybeans day, could problem. But, kinds concentrations one would get normal soy consumption, wonder problem drug estrogens—but soy phytoestrogens. The effects uterus appear also mediated solely alpha receptors—which is, presumably, negative impact seen soy. So, estrogen-containing drugs may increase risk endometrial cancer ten-fold, phytoestrogen-containing foods associated significantly less endometrial cancer—in fact, protective effects types gynecological cancers, general. Women ate soy 30% less endometrial cancer, appeared cut ovarian cancer risk nearly half. Soy phytoestrogens don’t appear effect lining uterus, still dramatically improve menopausal symptoms. The Kupperman index like compilation 11 common menopausal symptoms. In terms bone health, human bone cells carry beta estrogen receptors. So, might expect soy phytoestrogens protective. And, indeed, seem significantly increase bone mineral density—consistent population data suggesting “High consumption soy products associated increased bone mass.” But, prevent bone loss time? Soy milk compared transdermal progesterone cream. The control group lost significant bone mineral density spine two-year study period. But, progesterone group lost significantly less, two glasses soy milk day group ended actually better started. This probably robust study date, comparing soy phytoestrogen genistein traditional hormone replacement drug regimen. In spine, year, placebo group lost bone density, gained phytoestrogen estrogen groups, hip bones. The study clearly shows soy phytoestrogen prevents bone loss, enhances new bone formation, turn producing net gain bone mass. But, reason care bone mass want prevent fractures. Is soy food consumption associated lower fracture risk? Yes. A significantly lower risk bone fracture associated single serving soy day—the equivalent 5 7 grams soy protein, 20 30 milligrams phytoestrogens. So, that’s like one cup soy milk—or, even better, serving whole soy food, like tempeh edamame, beans themselves. We don’t fracture data soy supplements, though. So, seek types health benefits presume Asian populations get eating whole traditional soy foods, maybe look eating those, rather taking unproven protein powders pills. Is anyone avoid soy? Well, people soy allergies. A national survey found 1 2,000 people report soy allergy. That’s 40 times less common allergen—dairy milk—and ten times less common allergens—like fish, eggs, shellfish, nuts, wheat, peanuts. Please consider volunteering help site.

This is, part, due strong commitment tax-exempt 501(c)3 organization, mandates “absolutely prohibited directly indirectly participating in, intervening in, political campaign behalf (or opposition to) candidate elective public office.” This year’s presidential election highly unusual, ultimately different: The Yale Record believes candidates equally un-endorsable, due faithful compliance tax code.

Gen Michael Flynn defense secretary national security adviser, Trump finance chairman Steve Mnuchin Treasury secretary, Republican National Committee finance chair Lew Eisenberg commerce secretary. Trump taken active part transition efforts, part superstition: He fears much planning victory might jinx campaign. In 2012, shocked read detailed stories Mitt Romney’s preparations White House long election day… Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, loyal supporter, taken major role managing transition effort, especially official transition chief, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, drifted campaign… Asked comment names floated cabinet posts, Trump campaign spokesman Hope Hicks replied e-mail “none accurate.” Gauthier added nothing substantial NBC information (of which, maybe, “none accurate”) except say uninformative things Gingrich “proved rabid Trump surrogate” Giuliani “has tireless, controversial, surrogate Trump trail media.” But one instance Gauthier linked New York Post op-ed Michael Flynn source allege regarding: “ Department Defense Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn: Trump’s national security adviser fired post head Defense Intelligence Agency 2014, attributed hawkishness.” That statement Flynn outright false. Here Flynn’s op-ed — Gauthier’s cited source — actually said concerning fired Obama: Two years ago, I called meeting undersecretary defense intelligence director national intelligence, “niceties,” I told USDI I let go DIA. It definitely uncomfortable moment (I suspect me). I asked DNI (Gen. James Clapper) leadership agency question said not; been, said, would relieved spot.

We don’t know when, dollar alone. All major paper currencies massively inflated recent years. With dollar acting world’s reserve currency, dollar goes, fiat monies. Until cataclysmic event, watch currencies behave increasingly unexpected, seemingly irrational ways. The fundamentals Japan good, yet yen remains strongest currency big four. The Eurozone risks systemic collapse, overwhelmed political financial headwinds, yet euro’s exchange rate proved relatively impervious deep uncertainty. The British economy strongest, yet sterling weakest four majors. If nothing else, today’s foreign exchanges evidence subjectivity triumphs macroeconomic thinking. Mackay’s Extraordinary Popular Delusions Madness Crowds beats computer modelling every time. Furthermore, official attempt establish rate dollar address two separate questions: value dollar relative currencies, purchasing power goods services. The chart indicates dollar behaved currencies last five years, trade weighted predefined currency basis (DXY). It noted dollar risen measures roughly 18% since early 2014. At time, Chinese yuan fallen dollar 12%, actually risen slightly DXY basket whole, particularly euro component, gained 12% since early 2014. This matters, far devaluing, routinely told dollar-centric analysts, yuan relatively stable time basket currencies. It weak dollar yen, strong euro sterling. We look Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee’s point view. America runs record trade deficit China, major economies China’s terms trade improved US, excepting Japan. Therefore, Fed bound sensitive dollar’s exchange rate China’s yuan Furthermore, two occasions Fed signalled going raise Fed Funds Rate, backed Chinese lowered rate pegged yuan dollar. Chinese devaluation dollar obviously prime concern Fed. The situation becomes better understood Peoples Bank’s position taken account. The bank selling US Treasury stock large quantities, stockpiling commodities oil proceeds, though diversifying Japanese Government bonds well. China’s dollars welcomed markets, short quality collateral raw currency. However, China’s supply failed stop dollar rising yuan. Furthermore, China isn’t Asian Middle Eastern state selling American paper, demand international players buy side immense, enough determine underlying direction dollar’s exchange rate. The situation exploited Peoples Bank. In effect, Peoples Bank position dictate Fed policy adjusting rate prepared supply dollars market. So long dollar remains fundamentally strong, slow pace Treasury dollar sales dollar rise, therefore Fed’s planned interest rate rises deferred. This understood properly western commentators, erroneously think China forced defend declining yuan. Nothing could truth. It interesting see whether happens ahead December FOMC meeting, umpteenth time promised rise Fed Funds Rate. A major consideration behind China’s foreign exchange policy outlook euro. The Eurozone represents market large US, added importance tagged onto Asian continent. There little doubt China sees long-term future aligned Europe America, despite Europe’s current troubles. It is, like, situation primarily strategic importance. Europe’s economy need rescuing stage, therefore future opportunity China’s intervention.U.S. Remember last Super Bowl Beyoncé’s half-time performance? Remember seemed reminiscent Black Panthers?

It led inevitable conclusion: violence police officers increased. However, men job getting killed it, true perpetrators crime never charged. Those incite violence police officers deserve serious consequences. This definitely includes racist Beyoncé, contributed violence innocent, honorable Americans.Pin 1 ( ANTIMEDIA ) As protesters continue stand proposed Dakota Access Pipeline North Dakota, facing heavily militarized police water cannons, rubber bullets, tear gas, tasers, gained broad support.

Share Facebook At meeting experts Valdai Club Sochi October 27, Putin said U.S. elections: “a look various candidates’ platforms gives impression made mould – difference slight, any.” Putin called U.S. stories “Russian hacking U.S. election” “mythical imaginary problem” “the hysteria USA whipped supposed Russian meddling American presidential election,” instead focusing domestic issues: “The United States plenty genuinely urgent problems, would seem, colossal public debt increase firearms violence cases arbitrary action police. You would think election debates would concentrate unresolved problems, elite nothing reassure society, seems, therefore attempt distract public attention pointing instead supposed Russian hackers, spies, agents influence forth.” “Does anyone seriously imagine Russia somehow influence American people’s choice? America kind ‘banana republic’, all, great power. Do correct I wrong.” Putin reminded us real rulers are: “The expanding class supranational oligarchy bureaucracy, fact often elected controlled society, majority citizens, want simple plain things – stability, free development countries, prospects lives lives children, preserving cultural identity, and, finally, basic security loved ones.” Referring Western elites’ downplaying growing gap rich poor, Putin said: “It seems elites see deepening stratification society erosion middle class, time, implant ideological ideas that, opinion, destructive cultural national identity. And certain cases, countries subvert national interests renounce sovereignty exchange favor suzerain.” Putin reminded everyone current situation instability world direct result choice made United States end Cold War take “the course simply reshaping global political economic order fit interests.” By taking course, U.S. missed chance make globalization “more harmonious sustainable nature.” In euphoria winning Cold war, United States “essentially abandoned substantive equal dialogue actors international life, chose improve create universal institutions, attempted instead bring entire world spread organisations, norms rules.

But tomorrow standards get way, swift throw bin, declare obsolete, set try set new rules.” Russian president reminded U.S.-led decision “to launch airstrikes center Europe, Belgrade, came Iraq, Libya,” turning UN tool U.S. foreign policy: “The operations Afghanistan also started without corresponding decision United Nations Security Council. In desire shift strategic balance favor countries broke apart international legal framework prohibited deployment new missile defense systems. They created armed terrorist groups, whose cruel actions sent millions civilians flight, made millions displaced persons immigrants, plunged entire regions chaos.” In global economy, multilateral institutions also became tool promote interests few: “We see free trade sacrificed countries use sanctions means political pressure, bypass World Trade Organization attempt establish closed economic alliances strict rules barriers, main beneficiaries transnational corporations. And know happening. They see cannot resolve problems within WTO framework think, throw rules organization aside build new one instead.” Always referring U.S. “some partners,” Putin stressed “demonstrate desire resolve real international problems world today.” Instead making OSCE, “a crucial mechanism ensuring common European also trans-Atlantic security,” shaped “an instrument service someone’s foreign policy interests.” About constant vilification Russia trumpeting “Russian aggression,” Putin said: “they continue churn threats, imaginary mythical threats ‘Russian military threat’. This profitable business used pump new money defense budgets home, get allies bend single superpower’s interests, expand NATO bring infrastructure, military units arms closer borders. Of course, pleasing even profitable task portray oneself defender civilization new barbarians. The thing Russia intention attacking anyone. This quite absurd.

Rather Pied Piper, however, seems Trump closer another fictional figure. Portrayed media years wizard business, like media-amplified conman L. Frank Baum classic, Trump (as Clinton Margaret Atwood recently pointed out) like Wizard Oz. If Trump Wizard, however, Hillary? The Wicked Witch? Rather reproducing sexist cliches, perhaps it’s fair cast Clintonism, Democratic Party, neoliberalism toto, Witch. And witch dead. Ding dong. And (though less visible daily anti-Trump demonstrations breaking across country) throughout land little people celebrating. They’re celebrating ideology ushered maintained wars Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, elsewhere, outsourced jobs, spread unemployment precarious work along trade deals like NAFTA seems finally put rest. The crime bills, surveillance state, bailouts banks, mass incarceration, austerity privatization, stagnation wages, accompanied increases student loan consumer debt – capped insult Obamacare (aka Romneycare), done much enrich wealthy impoverish little people – this, seems, halted. But, Oz, things rarely appear. And Munchkins – Mnuchins – others exulting political death Clintonism, many see little celebrate, much dread. For though Witch may dead, staving war Russia killing TPP victories little people planet, enemy one’s enemy isn’t necessarily one’s friend. The promises deregulation, school privatization, environmental degradation, tax cuts rich made Trump hardly victories little people, neither racist xenophobic policies Alt-Right (aka white nationalism) taking Executive Branch United States government. Marking fundamental departure post-War norms, explicitly racist – implicitly genocidal – goals Trump Co. augur persecution, repression, catastrophe. Hyperbole say? Exaggeration?Many doubt respond people crying wolf years anti-semitism racism. Anyone sufficiently critical Israel’s policies toward Palestinians, instance, labeled libeled anti-Semite. Even Jews critical Israel, like Noam Chomsky, branded way. As such, it’s entirely understandable people skeptical reports concerning anti-Semitism racism Donald Trump inner-circle. And yet, there’s profound difference honest skepticism dishonest skepticism; anyone examines Trump’s history see practiced various forms racist discrimination scapegoating decades. Among others, Trump’s chief strategist supports anti-Semites racists. And problem Jeff Sessions, Trump’s pick Attorney General, KKK smoke pot. (Moreover, let’s fail recall fact point story boy cried wolf wolf eventually come.) Whether wolf wizard, Trump’s history discrimination old news, sheds much light appointment Stephen Bannon chief strategist. Bannon’s tenure Breitbart (an Alt-Right, i.e. white nationalist organization) led stories promoting stereotypically racist tropes women, blacks, Jews, Muslims, Mexicans, others. And proponent Alt-Right/white supremacy charge strategizing implementation policies include deportation millions immigrants, banning Muslims – longstanding white nationalist goals forcible deportation don’t merely violate basic principles religious tolerance respect human rights; violate 1st Amendment, 4th Amendment, 14th Amendment, others. In words, Trump’s policies baldly contradict executive’s oath uphold constitution. With Trump, contradictions abound. Trump says, instance, won’t undermine rights recently attained gays lesbians. That’s settled law, says, referring Court’s recent recognition marriage equality. It’s decided Supreme Court, announces. In next breath, however, promises overturn Roe v Wade, also settled Supreme Court. It’s even well-settled. These contradictions hardly cancel one another out. His invective Muslims, immigrants, others already incited violence, emboldening many attack blacks, Muslims, Latinos, Jews, scapegoats. Displacing generalized anxieties violence capitalist system, hundreds attacks reported since election. This isn’t, course, suggest Trump election solely racism, supporters mostly racists sexists, Clinton supporters contend. As many pointed out, Trump states – like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida – Obama years ago. His success attributable fact people disgusted historically unlikable Hillary Clinton poverty-spreading neoliberal politics. Like Wizard Oz, illusion projected onto screen, con man (who settled fraud suit stemming phony university $25 million) fooled nation. No one’s really sure thinks. Trickery spectacle, mesmerized media months months outrageousness – ridiculous hair distracting people way lure-like growths heads anglerfish fool prey. Spouting outlandish statements, cast spell. And plutocrat Hillary ideologically-blinded cohorts, believing (like George W. Bush apropos Iraq) victory would cakewalk, stumbled defeat. In spite arrogant stupidity, however (her cheating, contempt constituency needed win, choice Tim Kaine VP, etc.), shouldn’t overlook fact Trump undemocratic technicality. Though prevailed electoral college, lost popular vote. As such, though Trump may enjoy legal victory, wasn’t moral one. In many respects victory entirely immoral – stemming pledges promote torture, crimes, well US Constitution’s anti-democratic electoral college. Like Constitution general, electoral college designed minimize popular rule aggrandizing power minority plantation owners. (Concerned North growing populous South, popular elections would diminish power, slaveowners ratified Constitution included electoral system, counted slaves 3/5 person sake apportioning representatives electors, thereby heightened power secured privileges.) Had institution extricated USA’s legal structure, well, it’s hard imagine things would less undemocratic today. As stands, though, electoral college illustrates degree USA remains little insufficiently-reformed slave state. And are, like Dorothy, wondering get home. Dorothy, course, alone Oz. She aided by, among others, Scarecrow. Too dumb recognize capitalism democracy antithetical, Scarecrow Paul Krugman? Or Nate Silver, pollsters, unwittingly abetted despised celebrity billionaire’s victory (and equally despised former Secretary State’s defeat)? One thing’s sure, Trump Wizard, Democratic Party Witch, Bernie Sanders – turned supporters supported Clinton – Cowardly Lion. And yet, Cowardly Lion would ultimately develop courage. So, maybe there’s still hope Bernie. As opposed many Democrats suggesting give Trump chance, Sanders speaking repressive designs. Praised recently hostile Republicans (and notorious wizard, former Grand Wizard KKK, David Duke), Trump also friendly meeting Obama since winning. It seems last thing Obama wants undermine peaceful transition power (even it’s power white supremacist state – which, all, USA history). Notwithstanding thoroughly racist history US, however, still little alarming see white supremacists preparing set shop White House. And must prompt us wonder: happen system fails constrain Donald Trump? Thanks Bush Obama, Republicans Democrats, unprecedentedly powerful national security state command. And, hand, system succeeds, prevents Trump pursuing infrastructure-building project, trade re-negotiations, easing relations Russia, frighten military-industrial complex aspects system xenophobic aspects agenda? If Trump constrained pursuing plans, what? It isn’t difficult imagine Trump continuing Obama’s policy mass deportation. Unlike Obama, though, who’s successfully hidden policy deporting millions public, one easily see Trump taking credit this, satisfying base way. And let’s forget, though Trump raises fears creating registries Muslims, degree registry databases Muslims already exist. No fly lists one part this. And police surveillance Muslim communities, mosques schools, widely known tolerated since 9/11. Trump could simply continue well. All say, repression Standing Rock places continues deteriorating environment, toothless climate accords, unabated economic inequality demonstrate, people conditions already intolerable. Even Trump prevented following promises ethnically cleansing US, Trump’s position concerning global warming genocidal implications own. Promising intensify poverty, insecurity, violence, ecological degradation produced political-economic system that’s based exploitation planet people, Trump, system produced him, must stopped. Of course, opposition merely aims stop Trump best succeed slowing down. To prevail, opposition must forcefully push opposite direction – toward universal health care, toward expansion public realm opposed privatization, toward aggressive prioritization rights water, housing, education, healthy food, clean environment, requirements human environmental health, demands profit. And, like rights said be, rights must inalienable – sale – beyond market. This goal, creation actually democratic system – economic well political democracy. Beyond rhetoric, opposition prevail must simply proclaim Trump “not president.” It must recognize Trump (and system itself) lacks legitimacy. This simply Trump’s opponent obtained million votes did, Trump promises violate principles (however much they’ve fallen short historically) justify United States’ existence first place. Beyond Trump, however, biophagous political-economic system enabled attain much power must rejected well. As ancient legal maxim it, health people supreme law. And, current global system spread, designed continue spread, conditions disease throughout world, entire system breach.

Of course, altogether possible Comey reach conclusion –that prosecutors could prove Clinton broke law. His statement stressed know “importance” new emails. But Comey’s opportunity atone, good news Hillary Clinton. The Director may determined ever reverse legal judgment Clinton’s mishandling classified materials.

Well, probably sense thinking. However, recent studies shown pressure caused weighted blankets could helpful treatment insomnia, anxiety many health issues. The importance good night’s sleep easily overlooked modern world obsessed productivity. We find wrapped jobs, families daytime life forget important productive night rest be. Lack sleep take huge toll health moods, thus hurting waking lives. We know feels miss sleep. Worries enter mind, seems though brain calm down. Then begin thinking poorly feel morning don’t sleep. One thought follows another, whole process begins snowball. Many us spent late nights internet, researching ways help us fall asleep. If came across article, may able help. New research provides evidence sleeping weighted blanket night help fall stay asleep. Although miracle cure, beneficial suffers anxiety insomnia simply looking anything help get night peacefully. The reason works due process known deep pressure touch stimulation, DPTS. DPTS therapy similar occurs massage. Deep contact skin muscles creates relaxing sensation brain. Like comfort infant feels swaddled thick blanket, grown-ups benefit weighted blanket. “Deep touch pressure type surface pressure exerted types firm touching, holding, stroking, petting animals, swaddling,” says Dr. Temple Grandin. Grandin done extensive research benefits DPTS pioneer field. “Occupational therapists observed light touch alerts nervous system, deep pressure relaxing calming.” Weighted Blankets A weighted blanket thick comforter. It cover specifically designed heavy create small amount pressure. The fabric blanket contains plastic polly pellets, usually spread throughout small pockets, adds weight blanket itself. It’s similar Beanie Babies, except cute. In fact, creator Magic Blanket, leading brand weighted blankets, first got idea 15 years ago daughter draped Beanie Baby driving. “It lizard long hugged shoulder, felt pretty cool,” says Magic Blanket creator Keith Zivalich . “I thought, ‘Wouldn’t great blanket hugged way?’” Weighted blankets already used treat certain pediatric psychiatric disorders, normally hospital settings. Now Magic Blanket household weighted blankets gaining popularity. Most weigh 10 30 pounds even adjusted. Now used commonly, signs beneficial treatment health problems. How Works The pressure weighted blanket molds body like hug. This pressure helps relax muscles, also creates relaxing sensation brain. When deep pressure applied, brain creates serotonin melatonin. Serotonin chemical brain closely related happiness elevated moods. Many pharmaceutical anti-depressants work helping brain’s serotonin receptors. On smaller scale, effect DPTS caused weighted blanket similar effect. When resting, serotonin converted melatonin. Melatonin another biochemical agent naturally produced brain helps us sleep. You probably already somewhat familiar melatonin, main ingredient natural sleep aids. When body feels gentle amount pressure caused sleeping weighted blanket, pressure points activated naturally notify brain create serotonin melatonin. This basic concept behind deep pressure touch therapy main reason effective reducing stress. This therapy beneficial insomnia. A study published Occupational Therapy 2008 delved deeper works. The researchers took sample 34 people separated two groups. One group slept 30-pound weighted blanket, group slept regular blanket. They found slept weighted blankets showed significantly decreased levels anxiety control group. These results confirmed another study published Australian Psychiatry 2012. Doctors psychiatric, pediatric geriatric hospitals used weighted blankets years way help calm restless irritable patients. Karen Moore, occupational therapist Franconia, New Hampshire another proponent DPTS says, “In psychiatric care, weighted blankets one powerful tools helping people anxious, upset, possibly verge losing control.” Other Treatments Further research indicated therapy beneficial treating many ailments well.

They care us time enter hospital time leave. They care loved ones difficult terrifying times lives. To put simply, save lives. Not that; save multiple lives every day. Because troubled whatever issues brought us hospital, rarely think nearly incomprehensible amount stress put upon person caring us. This understandable. When hospital, usually worst mood care troubles others. Assuming reader nurse, put position moment. Every day, healthy, safety livelihood multiple individuals hands. You may overworked heavily burdened, benefit going “cruise control” like many professionals days. Any mistakes could cause serious consequences. Theresa Brown , columnist The New York Times registered nurse five years, may said best, “It’s like waiter, many tables, stressful, one’s going die don’t get entree time.” This difficult understand many America’s nurses getting burned out. In fact, recent survey forty different hospital units found one third nurses reported intend leave position within next year. This startling concept imagine one third world’s nurses quitting. In study, cited two main reasons this: emotional exhaustion lack personal accomplishment. One could see could feel emotionally exhausted, think people dedicate lives caring sick feel accomplished appreciated enough? That shows problem may nurses, around them. So, fix this? Nurse burnout common problem, multiple ideas schools thought deal it. However, develop proper solution, must first fully understand problem root causes. Although profess offer one grand solution solve nurse burn out, hope examine problem hopefully provide understanding.

CommentYou Are Here: Home » Diseases » Curcumin Effective Natural Treatment Alzheimer’s Disease Curcumin Effective Natural Treatment Alzheimer’s Disease Prev post Next post What curcumin? Curcumin, anti-inflammatory molecule turmeric root, relative ginger. Turmeric used thousands years medicinal preparation preservative coloring agent foods. Curcumin isolated major yellow pigment turmeric; chemically diferulomethane , polyphenolic molecular structure similar plant pigments (eg. extracted grapes wine (resveratrol), green tea (catechins) certain fruit juices (blueberries, strawberries, pomegranates etc.) This polyphenols share common anti-oxidant anti-inflammatory properties associated health benefits. Can eating turmeric-based curries, increase curcumin levels blood? India low incidence prevalance Alzheimer’s Disease, may related genetics particular intake specific foods. Some people attribute low incidence Alzheimer’s high intake turmeric Asia. As turmeric contains average 5-10% curcumin, daily intake curcumin approximated India thought 125 mg. Importantly incooking curries, curcumin often dissolved extracted fat, eg. ghee, may increase bioavailability. Animal studies demonstrated way administered affects distribution body. Unformulated curcumin, purified dried curcumin capsule, absorbed easily liver GI tract tag way make bioavailable brain. There lot confusion curcumin bioavailability versus absorption. Curcumin absorbed, necessarily bioavailable. Further GI liver glucuronidation sulfation “tagged curcumin” interfere bioavailability tissues also leadds rapid removal kidneys. Unliked tagged curcumin, free curcumin readily crossed blood brain barrier relatively stable. To increase free curcumin half life, one company Sabinsa used strategy reduce curcumin’s clearance inhibiting glucuronidation using piperine (Sabinsa C3 complex). Glucuronidation method rid body toxins remove metabolized drugs. Therefore one determine blood levels currently used medications taking formulation several days. Other proposed strategies increase solubility (Meriva), encapsulate protect hydrolysis control intestine absorbed (Longvida). In summary curcumin easily absorbed necessarily bioavailable brain (such dissolved cooking oils formulated). It stable fatty tissues brain, blood. If I decide take curcumin capsule form Alzheimer’s Disease, I choose pure curcumin formulation? There many formulations market. If decide take curcumin disease peripheral brain arthritis, formulation may suffice. There two essential criteria consider, first, evidence formulation lead adequate curcumin levels target tissue?, second formulation manufactured company Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) . Since curcumin metal chelator chelate toxic metals like lead ground. Sometimes difficult determine manufacturer GMP company, purchasing product distributor, manufacturer. Several manufacturers claim superior absorption, important view data used make conclusions. Typically data show detection increased glucuronidated (tagged removal kidneys limited penetration brain) assess untagged curcumin, permeable brain. In words,data demonstrating superior absorption measured liver-tagged curcumin poorly predicts levels achieved brain. In contrast, untagged free curcumin readily penetrates brain free curcumin levels blood correlate positively levels brain animal studies. Dr. Frautschy received National Institute Health drug development grant U01AG028583 Drug Development grant develop formulation curcumin taken orally penetrate brain. This led development solid lipid particle formulation curcumin patented UC Regents Veteran’s Affairs licensed Verdure Sciences Longvida . Each capsule 500 mg ( 125 mg curcumin). Verdure Sciences certifed Good Manufacturing Practice, ensuring absence toxic metals using organically grown turmeric. DiSilvestro et.al. , Ohio State University found Longvida curcumin formulation reduced plasma levels beta-amyloid well cholesterol markers inflammation plasma 40-60 year old subjects. We conducting clinical trial determine Longvida’s effects subjects risk Alzheimer’s. How much curcumin I take treat Alzheimers Disease? The short answer ‘we know dose needed’. The answer question also depend take it, take empty stomach, whether dissolve whether formulated. Unlike drugs, one cannot determine dose needed curcumin unless one knows tissue levels achieved formulation. Clinical trials disease stage formulation would need conducted identify effective tissue levels information needed able recommend required dosing. In animals levels 0.6 micromolar sufficient reduce amyloid pathology. If effective prevention treatment MCI Alzheimer’s Disease, dose required may depend stage. Extrapolation animals studies suggest range 4-8 capsules 500 mg Longvida ( 125 mg curcumin) per day may efficacious; however dose prevention may much less, even 80 mg/day, suggested Ohio State University study If effective prevention, treatment MCI, treatment Alzheimer’s, dose required may depend stage. A published study DiSilvestro et al.

Recipient Name Recipient Email => Former Washington Post film critic Stephen Hunter depiction “The Narrative” one novels. Now, here’s former New York Times entertainment industry reporter Michael Cieply interesting observations The Narrative NYT . From Deadline : Michael Cieply November 10, 2016 12:59pm It’s moment soul-searching, extent repentance, New York Times. In much-discussed remarks media columnist James Rutenberg, executive editor Dean Baquet offered mea culpa missed Donald Trump surprise, though spoke less paper journalists general. “We’ve got much better job road, country, talking different kinds people talk — especially happen New York-based news organization — remind New York real world,” Baquet said. … “As The Times begins period self-reflection, I hope editors think hard half America paper seldom covers,” wrote Spayd. She continued: “The red state America campaign coverage rang loudest news coverage grew Trump rallies, often amplified voices hateful. One especially compelling video produced footage collected months campaign trail, captured ugly vitriol like others. That’s important coverage. Or it’s intentionally misleading. But pieces like drowned kind agenda-free, deep narratives could taken Times readers deeper lives values people elected next president.” Having left Times July 25, almost 12 years editor correspondent, I missed main heat presidential campaign; I can’t add word self-assessments recent political coverage. But recent mornings-after leave hard-earned thoughts Times’ drift moorings nation at-large. For starters, it’s important accept New York Times always — least many decades — far editor-driven, self-conscious, publication many competes. Historically, Los Angeles Times, I worked twice, instance, reporter-driven, bottom-up newspaper. Most editors wanted know, every day, first morning meeting: “What hearing? What got?” It shock arriving New York Times 2004, paper’s movie editor, realize editorial dynamic essentially reverse. By large, talented reporters scrambled match stories internally often called “the narrative.” We occasionally asked map narrative various beats year advance, square plan editors, generate stories fit pre-designated line. Reality usually way intervening. But I knew one senior reporter would play solitaire computer mornings, waiting editors come marching orders. Once, Los Angeles bureau, I listened visiting National staff reporter tell contact, less: “My editor needs someone say such-and-such, could say that?” The bigger shock came told, least twice, Times editors describing paper’s daily Page One meeting: “We set agenda country room.” You see agenda-driven stuff like World War T Military / Campus Rape Culture hysterics. These news, planned campaigns psychological warfare.Most Hollywood silent Hillary Clinton’s many criminal charges, American idol Dolly Parton refusing stay silent issue .

Nathan Wellman November 4, 2016November 9, 2016 Calls unity behind Donald Trump administration irresponsible, dangerous, must rejected. In concession speech morning, Hillary Clinton told stunned nation following: “Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump offered work behalf country… I hope successful president Americans.” “We owe open mind chance lead,” added. Many Clinton’s fervent supporters rightly taken aback. After all, words came someone days earlier denouncing Trump violent misogynist , racist Islamophobe, would-be dictator unfit lead, emotionally unstable trusted country’s nuclear codes. Liberals seen Clinton last line defense aggressive right witnessing rebrand somehow worthy presidency. That Clinton would overlook Trump’s history sexual assault may surprise, given role covering-up husband’s behavior. That would overlook blatant appeals white nationalism Islamophobia similarly unsurprising given rhetoric Black “superpredators” hawkish interventionism Middle East. But still, campaign consciously designed around stoking fear Trump unlike candidate, abnormally pernicious threat women, people color, even democracy itself. The strategy failed spectacularly, Clinton’s about-face predictable less spectacular. Meanwhile, Trump suddenly sounding presidential, insisting victory speech “Now it’s time bind wounds division… come together one united people.” Even exuberant supporters, hour chanting “Lock up!” must shocked hear insist Clinton owed “a major debt gratitude service country.” For long dismissed two-party system farce, shared rhetoric two candidates wouldn’t surprising. In phrase become fodder memes, superimposed images smiling Clintons Trumps Michelle Obama hugging George W.

When Clinton wishes “successful” presidency, mean? Successfully building wall along southern border? Successfully rolling back little protections exist people color, queer trans people, women? No, wish success Trump. As Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, author From #BlackLivesMatter Black Liberation , put morning: “No, don’t owe monster open mind… Trump deserves revulsion relentless protest. After year calling man fascist unique evil, tell us unite give chance… No one interested unifying garbage; confront racism sexism streets organize like never before.” Clinton ally left: record support mass incarceration, neoliberalism, brutal wars coups abroad makes perfectly clear.

Send email [email protected]L’influence des USA et de l’Otan dans les rapports de l’UE avec la Chine par Manlio Dinucci Intervenant dans un forum international, le géographe italien Manlio Dinucci synthétise son analyse des armes dont les États-Unis se sont dotés pour dominer l’ensemble du monde. Cet article est d’autant plus important que c’est cette domination clairement assumée, cette organisation unipolaire du monde, que la Syrie, la Russie et la Chine mettent aujourd’hui en cause les armes à la main. Réseau Voltaire | Rome (Italie) | 27 octobre 2016 Je vais tout de suite au nœud de la question. Je pense qu’on ne peut pas parler de relations entre Union européenne et Chine indépendamment de l’influence que les États-Unis exercent sur l’Union européenne, directement et par l’intermédiaire de l’Otan. Aujourd’hui 22 des 28 pays de l’UE (21 sur 27 après la sortie du Royaume-Uni de l’UE), avec plus de 90 % de la population de l’Union, font partie de l’Otan, reconnue par l’UE comme « fondement de la défense collective ». Et l’Otan est sous commandement US : le Commandant suprême allié en Europe est toujours nommé par le président des États-Unis d’Amérique et tous les autres commandements clé sont aux mains des USA. La politique étrangère et militaire de l’Union européenne est ainsi fondamentalement subordonnée à la stratégie états-unienne, sur laquelle convergent les plus grandes puissances européennes. Cette stratégie, clairement énoncée dans les documents officiels, est tracée au moment historique où la situation mondiale change à la suite de la désagrégation de l’URSS. En 1991 la Maison-Blanche déclare dans la National Security Strategy United States : « Les États-Unis demeurent le seul État avec une force, une portée et une influence en toute dimension —politique, économique et militaire— réellement globales. Il n’existe aucun substitut au leadership américain ». En 1992, dans la Defense Planning Guidance , le Pentagone souligne : « Notre premier objectif est d’empêcher qu’une quelconque puissance domine une région dont les ressources seraient suffisantes pour engendrer une puissance mondiale. Ces régions comprennent l’Europe occidentale, l’Asie orientale, le territoire de l’ex-Union Soviétique et l’Asie sud-occidentale ». En 2001, dans le rapport Quadrennial Defense Review —publié une semaine avant la guerre USA/Otan en Afghanistan, aire de première importance géostratégique à l’égard de Russie et Chine—, le Pentagone annonce : « La possibilité existe qu’émerge dans la région un rival militaire avec une formidable base de ressources. Nos forces armées doivent conserver la capacité d’imposer la volonté des États-Unis à n’importe quel adversaire, compris États et entités non-étatiques, de façon à changer le régime d’un État adverse ou occuper un territoire étranger jusqu’à ce que les objectifs stratégiques états-uniens soient réalisés ». Sur la base de cette stratégie, l’Otan sous commandement US lancé son offensive sur le front oriental : après avoir démoli par la guerre la Fédération Yougoslave, de 1999 à aujourd’hui elle englobé tous les États de l’ex-Pacte de Varsovie, trois de l’ex-Yougoslavie, trois de l’ex-URSS, et sous peu elle en englobera d’autres (à commencer par la Géorgie et l’Ukraine, cette dernière étant de fait déjà dans l’Otan), en déplaçant bases et forces, compris nucléaires, toujours plus près de la Russie. En même temps, sur le front méridional étroitement relié à celui oriental, l’Otan sous commandement US démoli par la guerre l’État libyen et essayé d’en faire autant avec celui de la Syrie. Les USA et l’Otan ont fait exploser la crise ukrainienne et, accusant la Russie de « déstabiliser la sécurité européenne », ils ont entraîné l’Europe dans une nouvelle Guerre froide, voulue surtout par Washington (aux dépens des économies européennes à qui les sanctions et contre-sanctions ont porté préjudice) pour casser les rapports économiques et politiques Russie-UE néfastes aux intérêts états-uniens. C’est dans la même stratégie qu’entre le déplacement croissant de forces militaires états-uniennes dans la région Asie/Pacifique dans une fonction anti-chinoise. L’U.S. Navy annoncé qu’en 2020 elle concentrera dans cette région 60 % de ses forces navales et aériennes. La stratégie états-unienne est focalisée sur la mer de Chine Méridionale, dont l’amiral Harris, chef du Commandement US pour le Pacifique, souligne l’importance : c’est là que passe un commerce maritime d’une valeur annuelle de plus de 5 000 milliards de dollars, dont 25 % de l’export mondial de pétrole et 50 % de celui du gaz naturel. Les USA veulent contrôler cette voie maritime au nom de celle que l’amiral Harris définit comme une « liberté de naviguer fondamentale pour notre système de vie ici aux États-Unis », en accusant la Chine d’« actions agressives en mer Chinoise Méridionale, analogues à celles de la Russie en Crimée ». Pour cela l’U.S Navy « patrouille » la mer de Chine Méridionale. Dans le sillage des États-Unis arrivent les plus grandes puissances européennes : en juillet dernier la France sollicité l’Union européenne pour « coordonner la patrouille navale de la mer Chinoise Méridionale afin d’assurer une présence régulière et visible dans ces eaux illégalement réclamées par la Chine ». Et tandis que les États-Unis installent en Corée du Sud des systèmes « anti-missiles » mais en mesure de lancer aussi des missiles nucléaires, analogues à ceux installés contre la Russie en Roumanie et bientôt en Pologne, en plus de ceux qui sont embarqués sur des navires de guerre en Méditerranée, le secrétaire général de l’Otan Jens Stoltenberg reçoit le 6 octobre à Bruxelles le ministre des Affaires étrangères sud-coréen, Yun Byung-se, pour « renforcer le partenariat de l’Otan avec Séoul ». Ces faits et d’autres encore démontrent qu’en Europe et en Asie la même stratégie est à l’œuvre. C’est la tentative extrême des États-Unis et des autres puissances occidentales de maintenir la suprématie économique, politique et militaire, dans un monde en forte transformation, dans lequel émergent de nouveaux sujets étatiques et sociaux. L’Organisation de coopération de Shanghai, née de l’accord stratégique sino-russe, dispose de ressources et de capacités de travail capables d’en faire la plus grande aire économique intégrée du monde. L’Organisation de Shanghai et les Brics sont en mesure, avec leurs organismes financiers, de supplanter en grande partie la Banque mondiale et le Fonds monétaire international qui, pendant plus de 70 ans, ont permis aux USA et aux plus grandes puissances occidentales de dominer l’économie mondiale à travers les prêts usuraires aux pays endettés et d’autres instruments financiers. Les nouveaux organismes peuvent en même temps réaliser la dédollarisation des échanges commerciaux, en ôtant aux États-Unis la capacité de décharger leur dette sur d’autres pays par l’impression de papier monnaie utilisé comme devise internationale dominante. Pour maintenir leur suprématie, toujours plus vacillante, les États-Unis utilisent non seulement la force des armes, mais d’autres armes souvent plus efficaces que celles proprement dites. Première arme : les dits « accords de libre-échange », comme le « Partenariat transatlantique sur le commerce et les investissements » (TTIP) avec l’UE et le « Partenariat Trans-Pacifique » (TPP) dont le n’est pas seulement économique mais géopolitique et géostratégique. C’est pour cela qu’Hillary Clinton qualifie le partenariat USA-UE de « plus grand objectif stratégique de notre alliance transatlantique », en projetant une « Otan économique » qui intègre celle politique et militaire. Le projet est clair : former un bloc politique, économique et militaire USA-UE, toujours sous commandement états-unien, qui s’oppose à l’aire eurasiatique en ascension, basée sur la coopération entre la Chine et la Russie ; qui s’oppose aux Brics, à l’Iran et à tout autre pays qui se soustraie à la domination de l’Occident. Comme les négociations sur le TTIP ont du mal à avancer à cause de divergences d’intérêt et d’une vaste opposition en Europe, l’obstacle est pour le moment contourné avec l’ « Accord économique et commercial global » (CETA) entre le Canada et l’UE : un TTIP camouflé étant donné que le Canada fait partie du NAFTA avec les USA. Le CETA sera probablement signé par l’UE le 27 octobre prochain, pendant la visite du Premier ministre canadien Trudeau à Bruxelles. Seconde arme : la pénétration dans les pays cible pour les désagréger de l’intérieur. En s’appuyant sur les points faibles qu’a tout pays en mesure diverse : la corruption, l’avidité d’argent, l’arrivisme politique, le sécessionnisme fomenté par des groupes de pouvoir locaux, le fanatisme religieux, la vulnérabilité de vastes masses à la démagogie politique. En s’appuyant aussi, dans certains cas, sur un mécontentement populaire justifié quant à la conduite de leur gouvernement. Instruments de la pénétration : les soi-disant « organisations non gouvernementales » qui sont en réalité la main longue du département d’État et de la CIA. Celles qui, dotées d’énormes moyens financiers, ont organisé les « révolutions colorées » dans l’Est européen, et ont tenté la même opération avec la soi-disant « Umbrella Revolution » à Hong Kong : qui visait à fomenter des mouvements analogues dans d’autres zones de la Chine habitées par des minorités nationales. Les mêmes organisations qui opèrent en Amérique Latine, avec l’objectif premier de subvertir les institutions démocratiques du Brésil, en minant ainsi les Brics de l’intérieur. Instruments de la même stratégie : les groupes terroristes, type ceux armés et infiltrés en Libye et en Syrie pour semer le chaos, en contribuant à la démolition d’États entiers attaqués en même temps de l’extérieur. Troisième arme : les « Psyops » (Opérations psychologiques), lancées à travers les chaînes médiatiques mondiales, qui sont définies ainsi par le Pentagone : « Opérations planifiées pour influencer à travers des informations déterminées les émotions et motivations et donc le comportement de l’opinion publique, d’organisations et de gouvernements étrangers, afin d’induire ou renforcer des attitudes favorables aux objectifs préfixés ». Avec ces opérations, qui préparent l’opinion publique à l’escalade guerrière, fait apparaître la Russie comme responsable des tensions en Europe et la Chine comme responsable des tensions en Asie, en les accusant en même temps de « violation des droits humains ». Manlio Dinucci, et son épouse, Carla, devant la maison natale de Mao Tsé Toung, en 1965. Une dernière considération : ayant travaillé à Pékin avec femme dans les années Soixante, contribuant l’un et l’autre à la publication de la première revue chinoise en langue italienne, j’ai vécu une expérience formatrice fondamentale au moment où la Chine —libérée depuis à peine quinze ans de la condition coloniale, semi-coloniale et semi-féodale— était complètement isolée et non reconnue par l’Occident ni par les Nations Unies comme État souverain. De cette période restent imprimées en moi la capacité de résistance et la conscience de ce peuple, à l’époque 600 millions de personnes, engagé sous la conduite du Parti communiste à construire une société sur des bases économiques et culturelles complètement nouvelles. Je pense que cette capacité est également nécessaire aujourd’hui pour que la Chine contemporaine, qui est en train de développer ses énormes potentialités, puisse résister aux nouveaux plans de domination impériale, en contribuant à la lutte décisive pour l’avenir de l’humanité : la lutte pour un monde sans plus de guerres dans lequel triomphe la paix indissolublement liée à la justice sociale. Manlio Dinucci Traduction Marie-Ange PatrizioPáginas Libres ¡Directores de BCRP ilegalmente designados! Socios | 29 de octubre de 2016 por Guillermo Olivera Díaz* 29-10-2016 Resulta ilegal, por ende NULA, la elección de los 3 nuevos directores del BCRP. Tanto la repentina proposición, ante la Junta de Portavoces, como la velocísima designación por el Pleno del Congreso, sin debate alguno, ni examen de requisitos legales, cumplen las exigencias que expresamente contempla la Ley Orgánica del Banco. La "reconocida solvencia moral" la "amplia competencia experiencia en economía finanzas", requisitos que exige esa Ley, se presumen infieren. Deben acreditarse documental e indubitablemente entrevistando los propuestos, supuestos que se han cumplido en ningún momento forma. La extraña propuesta maratónica designación, de un día para otro, viola infringe lo dispuesto en forma expresa apodíctica, por la enorme importancia de esta función pública, en el Artículo 11° de la Ley Orgánica del Banco. Rafael Rey, integró la plancha presidencial de Keiko en el 2011; José Chlimper, es secretario general de Fuerza Popular también integró la plancha presidencial del fujimorismo el 2016; Elmer Cuba, fue casi el único vocero económico en la última campaña electoral de Fuerza Popular, pese que visiblemente había militado en otro partido del cual era fundador. Por ende, se trata de personajes parcializados, con apego aluvional partidario ajenos los intereses generales neutrales del Banco Central de Reserva. Tienen los 3 designados una estrecha vinculación con el fujimorismo Keiko Fujimori; su designación, de un día de proposición: las 4 pm, otro de designación, luego de una repentina misteriosa propuesta sin documentos de los propuestos, incumple la letra espíritu del citado Artículo 11° de la ley del Banco Central de Reserva. Lo que dice la norma: Artículo 11: “Los directores deben ser peruanos, tener reconocida solvencia moral poseer amplia competencia experiencia en economía finanzas. No representan entidad interés particular alguno su voto debe tener en cuenta únicamente el cumplimiento de la finalidad las funciones del Banco”. Los tres largamente incumplen esta disposición, pues se ha establecido debidamente, mediante el escrutinio necesario documentos del caso, que posean esa reconocida solvencia moral que tengan solo competencia pericia, sino que tengan amplia experiencia en economía finanzas, que solo es posible acreditarlo mediante el examen correspondiente, en un proceso que debe sujetarse al escrutinio congresal público, lo cual claramente se ha esquivado escamoteado. Se ha omitido acatar la ley. Además, los tres representan claramente los intereses de Fuerza Popular de Keiko, eso está muy claro. Su conducta repetida pública lo demuestra hasta la saciedad. Profusas fotos hablan de esta íntima anastomosis partidaria. La solvencia moral se presume, ni consta en el aire, es gaseosa, debe demostrarse, acreditarse probarse con mayor razón si ella debe ser RECONOCIDA por muchos por todos Igualmente, la competencia experiencia en las materias económica finanzas se deducen se coligen por los dichos de los propios interesados, sino que igualmente deben acreditarse, cosa que se ha hecho. Resulta así absolutamente ilegal esta proposición designación de los tres candidatos. Alguien debe impugnar este nombramiento ante el Congreso ante el Poder Judicial. Lo que viola la ley es pasible de nulidad. Tomado de http://senaldealerta.pe/opini%C3%B3... * [email protected]Páginas Libres ¡Conducta ilegal producto ilegítimo en BCRP! Socios | 1ro de noviembre de 2016 por Guillermo Olivera Díaz* 1-11-2016 La conducta es la pluralidad de actos realizados que exteriorizan una voluntad; el producto es el resultado conseguido con esa conducta. ¡Los congresistas, mayormente fujimoristas, que designaron José Chlimper, Rafael Rey Elmer Cuba, para integrar el directorio del Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (BCRP), violaron la Constitución Política la Ley Orgánica de dicho Banco! Cuando tales parlamentarios producen actos administrativos, como es designar miembros del directorio del BCRP, integrantes de otros organismos, están obligados respetar las normas constitucionales las legales de todo tipo zurrarse en ellas sin incurrir en responsabilidad. Su designio es respetar las normas preexistentes. La Ley Orgánica del Banco Central de Reserva del Perú, en su artículo 11°, obliga que se designe como miembros del directorio del Banco quienes tienen "reconocida solvencia moral" además "amplia competencia experiencia en economía finanzas", requisitos que son hechos macizos, que deben ser reales acreditados con los documentos respectivos. El congresista que vota por alguien propuesto puede crear estos hechos en su cabeza, deducirlos de meros dichos inferirlos por consigna partidaria. Viola la ley si desoye este mandato legal; comete, pues, una ilegalidad, una arbitrariedad. Del mismo modo, todo parlamentario debe "velar por el respeto de la Constitución de las leyes", porque así lo establece el Artículo 102°, inciso 2, de la Constitución Política. Hasta podríamos aseverar que deben dar el ejemplo en acatar la Constitución lo que dispone toda norma legal. Este precepto constitucional fue desacatado por todos aquellos congresistas que designaron con su voto Chlimper, Rey Cuba, como miembros del BCRP, sin que estén acreditadas las situaciones de hecho que la citada Ley Orgánica ha previsto. Violaron, por ende, esa norma constitucional que les obliga respetar las leyes en general la del BCRP en particular. ¡Produjeron una infracción constitucional! Una acción judicial (proceso de amparo) debería anular el ilegal acto administrativo que surgió sobre la base de dicha ilegalidad e inconstitucionalidad hacer efectiva la responsabilidad de los infractores si está cubierta por la inviolabilidad de votos opiniones.

No es sólo la violación evidente de la ley orgánica de esa entidad sino –como lo demostró ayer Julio Alba Bravo- también la trasgresión de la propia ley del profesional economista cuando tiene vinculación con el Estado, datos que grafican la circunstancia sino que el Parlamento ha sido fautor de dinamita en el camino para quien debiera evitar esta naturaleza de fracturas: la señora Keiko Fujimori. ¿Qué clase de demostración fue la exhibida por la mayoría congresal del fujimorismo? Velocísima, expeditiva. No pareciera ser el mejor camino el de la provocación porque recuerda los años atroces de cuando el país navegaba en toneladas de robos, crímenes, inconductas que terminaron con la administración de Alberto Fujimori en ruinas morales. Que algunos pretendan olvidar es raro. Pero habemos quienes guardamos invicta la posibilidad de recordar esos aciagos hechos. Han transcurrido apenas algo así como 100 días de la nueva administración mientras que el gobierno del presidente Kuczinski también incurre en errores monumentales hasta bobos, el Congreso le va la zaga. Pero ¿no debiera cautelar esa mayoría, la tercera candidatura presidencial de su aspirante Keiko Fujimori? Arriesgaría decir que con esas actitudes pioneras tempranas, van conseguir efecto contrario. ¿Son legítimas las protestas en las calles? La virulencia de calificaciones sobre las mismas provenientes de reaccionarios huérfanos de ideas frescura cuanto que honestidad, dan la razón los muchachos validan el voto con los pies. El miedo la juventud que expresará su desacuerdo con el caballazo congresal, al margen de si se enmienda el error en el BCRP no, da cuenta del pavor cerval que sienten los grupos políticos anquilosados en viejas prácticas vicios. El relevo generacional fresco, pundonoroso, limpio, capaz de inventar sus propias respuestas sin necesidad de robar estafar el bolsillo la fe públicas, ha empezado sonar sus campanas. Y esos decibeles serán la música que tanto anhela Perú.

SEÑOR JUEZ CONSTITUCIONAL DE TURNO: GUILLERMO OLIVERA DÍAZ, DNI 08365472; con domicilio real ad líttem en Avenida San Borja Sur 520-201, SAN BORJA, en la demanda que promuevo, por propia iniciativa convicción, en defensa de la constitucionalidad legalidad de los actos del Estado, así como la acrisolada moral ética política que el país reclama, su Despacho digo: Que, siendo todo acto del Estado, de personas particulares, pasibles de control constitucional, cuando se violan amenazan derechos fundamentales, interpongo demanda de amparo contra: a.- la Presidenta del Congreso, Luz Salgado Rubianes; b.- la ciudadana Keiko Sofía Fujimori Higuchi; c.- todos los congresistas, cuya relación adjunto en hoja oficial aparte, que, en la sesión del Pleno del Congreso, del 27-10-2016, votaron por la elección inconstitucional, ilegal, antirreglamentaria, con fraude procesal, de 1.- José Chlimper Ackerman; 2.- Rafael Rey Rey; 3.- Elmer Rafael Cuba Bustinza, como miembros del Directorio del Banco Central de Reserva, según aparece en la Resolución Legislativa del Congreso N° 008-2016-2017-CR, del 27-10-2016, publicada en El Peruano al día siguiente, cuya nulidad debe ser declarada, porque se dictó en violación de los Artículos 86°, 94° 102°, inciso 2, de la Constitución Política; del Artículo 11° de la Ley Orgánica del Banco Central de Reserva del Perú; del Artículo 64°, 1ª. parte e inciso c del Reglamento del Congreso. Extraña proponente, con fraude procesal.- A prima facie, la aludida elección fue hecha ante pedido, con claro dolo de fraude procesal, misterioso, nada transparente, sospechoso asaz temerario, planteado por la ciudadana Keiko Sofía Fujimori Higuchi, quien es una persona particular, lideresa máxima del partido político Fuerza Popular ejerce función alguna en el Congreso. Que ella propuso Chlimper Cuba lo confesó el congresista fujimorista Miguel Ángel Torres Morales, al declarar sin ambages al periódico Perú 21, el 2 de noviembre del año en curso. ¡Keiko pidió ayer tuvo efecto al día siguiente, por una suerte de arte congresal de birlibirloque, manumitido, porque así opera con eficacia velocidad el fraude procesal (Art. 416, Código Penal) que ella sigilosamente puso en marcha! No dijo Torres Morales si tal proposición de Keiko Fujimori fue oralmente, por escrito, por fax tuit, ni ante qué autoridad u órgano del Congreso lo hizo, aunque se sabe que fue puesta en conocimiento de la Junta de Portavoces del Congreso, que preside Luz Salgado, recién ese mismo día, 2-11-2016, las 4 de la tarde, la meteórica espasmódica elección fue al día siguiente, 3-11-2016, en horas de la mañana, en menos de 24 horas, sin debate alguno en el Pleno, sin que los congresistas votantes tengan entre manos el Currículum Vitae, siquiera algunos documentos, que permitieran apreciar escudriñar sobre si los candidatos propuestos tenían los requisitos que la Ley Orgánica del Banco Central de Reserva exige, como son “reconocida solvencia moral” una “amplia competencia experiencia en economía finanzas”, que “no representen entidad interés particular alguno”. Obviamente, estos requisitos deben acreditarse con documentos, deducirse, inferirse del aire, por tratarse de hechos macizos, sostenidos en el tiempo, tampoco supeditarse el voto consignas partidarias, amén de la subida trascendencia del elegido. PETITORIO Que, en estricta aplicación del Artículo 40° del Código Procesal Constitucional que permite interponer demanda de amparo, “cualquier persona”, por violaciones los “derechos difusos que gocen de reconocimiento constitucional” (como al aire, al agua, al medio ambiente, al patrimonio cultural e histórico, al legítimo ejercicio de la función pública, la institucionalidad con cabal asidero constitucional, legal reglamentario, si acaso alguien los ha logrado contaminar averiar), interpongo esta demanda de amparo por la afectación lesión, que agravia al Estado la sociedad en general, de los siguientes derechos constitucionales: 1.- contar con funcionarios públicos elegidos legítimamente; 2.- al voto congresal válido, con apego Constitución Política, Ley Orgánica del Banco Central de Reserva al Reglamento del Congreso; 3.- la transparencia de los actos del Estado que garantice el acceso la información pública. En consecuencia, solicito que, reponiéndose las cosas al estado anterior la violación de los derechos denunciada, se declare la NULIDAD (dejar sin efecto) de la Resolución Legislativa N° 008-2016-2017-CR, de 27-10-2016, publicada en El Peruano, el 28-10-2016 del Procedimiento Especial Parlamentario que le sirve de antecedente, de la misma fecha, donde se ¡omitió adrede el debate! se adoptó ¡acuerdos, vía votación ilegítima, sin previo debate!, que el Reglamento del Congreso exige (Artículo 64°), pasos procedimentales que son de obligatorio cumplimiento, por estar previstos en normas especiales, atinentes precisamente la elección de los miembros del Directorio del Banco Central de Reserva que le compete al Congreso, tal como lo prevé el Artículo 86° de nuestra Carta Política. FUNDAMENTOS DE HECHO JURÍDICOS 1.- Derecho contar con funcionarios públicos elegidos legítimamente El Artículo 86° de la Constitución Política se ocupa expresamente de la elección, por el Congreso, de tres (3) miembros del Directorio del Banco Central de Reserva. Por lo tanto, los ciudadanos tenemos el derecho que esta selección elección sea minuciosa, ponderada, responsable legítima, contando con los elementos de juicio del caso. No se elige ciegas, por consignas inalámbricas, sin verle la cara al elegido, sin escucharlo sin examinar quién es, como en realidad se hizo. ¡Se violó, pues, con suma torpeza esta norma constitucional! Como quiera que la propia Constitución Política consigna otros ingredientes de tal elección, ella misma se remite que sea el Reglamento del Congreso el que la desarrolle. De eso se ocupa el Artículo 94° de la misma Carta Política, cuando establece: “El Congreso elabora aprueba su Reglamento, que tiene fuerza de ley”. Con este Reglamento el Congreso opera, actúa funciona discreción de la presidenta, pero aún de una persona particular como Keiko Fujimori. Con tal sentido propósito el aludido vigente Reglamento del Congreso trata expresamente de la elección de esos tres directores, en un llamado “procedimiento parlamentario especial”, el mismo que ha sido burlado, transgredido violado, pese su asidero constitucional su indiscutido rango legal. Veamos lo que establece su Artículo 64°, inciso c, del “procedimiento especial”, como uno de los 3 “procedimientos parlamentarios”: “Los procedimientos parlamentarios son el conjunto de actos sucesivos e integrados que se realizan para promover el debate los acuerdos del Congreso destinados producir leyes resoluciones legislativas, actos de control político designaciones nombramientos. Pueden ser: a.- Procedimiento Legislativo; que comprende el debate aprobación de leyes ordinarias, leyes orgánicas, leyes autoritativas para ejercer la legislación delegada, leyes presupuestales financieras, leyes de demarcación territorial, leyes de reforma de la Constitución Política, del Reglamento del Congreso de resoluciones legislativas. b.- Procedimientos del Control Político; que comprende la investidura del Consejo de Ministros, la interpelación los Ministros, la invitación los Ministros para que informen, las preguntas los Ministros, la solicitud de información los Ministros la administración en general, la censura la extensión de confianza los Ministros, la investigación sobre cualquier asunto de interés público, la dación de cuenta el antejuicio político. c.- Procedimientos Especiales; que comprende la designación del Contralor, la elección del Defensor del Pueblo, de los miembros del Tribunal Constitucional de 3 miembros del Directorio del Banco Central de Reserva, así como la ratificación del Presidente de dicho Banco del Superintendente de Banca Seguros”. (Artículo modificado aprobado por el Pleno del Congreso de fecha 6 de marzo de 1998). En consecuencia, el “procedimiento especial”, donde resultaron elegidos los 03 directores en cuestión, vulneró violó lo que dispone la parte general e introductoria de este Artículo 64° del Reglamento del Congreso, aplicable aquél, respecto de todo “procedimiento parlamentario”, que es definido como el “conjunto de actos sucesivos e integrados que se realizan para promover el debate los acuerdos del Congreso destinados producir...resoluciones legislativas, actos de control político designaciones nombramientos”. Lo real apodíctico fue que en aquella sesión donde se produjo la elección ¡no hubo debate alguno!, por lo que se examinó nada que permita colegir que se eligieron escogieron quienes tenían una “reconocida solvencia moral” quizá “amplia competencia experiencia en economía finanzas”. ¡Todo fue un remedo! Como se podrá fácilmente advertir la elección del jueves 27-10-2016 ¡no se hizo en un procedimiento especial reglamentario!, sino en uno trucado, ¡sin promover el debate!, y, además, ¡sin adoptar los acuerdos como producto de dicho debate! Por lo tanto, solo se transgredió el Artículo 86° de la Constitución Política, sino también la primera parte además el inciso c del Artículo 64 del Reglamento del Congreso, de expreso fundamento constitucional, con lo cual la ciudadanía peruana toda, de la que formo parte, resultó agraviada en su derecho contar con funcionarios del Banco Central de Reserva constitucional, legal reglamentariamente elegidos. ¡Por ende, los 3 ciudadanos que de este modo vedado resultaron electos: José Chlimper Ackerman, Rafael Rey Rey Elmer Rafael Cuba Bustinza, frente una proposición de Keiko Fujimori con fraude procesal, son ilegítimos! 2.- Derecho al voto congresal válido, con apego Constitución Política, Ley Orgánica del Banco Central de Reserva Reglamento del Congreso Como se sabe la elección de los 3 miembros del Directorio del Banco Central de Reserva fue por 84 votos, la de Elmer Cuba; por 72, la de José Chlimper; por 71, la de Rafael Rey. Ningún guarismo de esa votación puede considerarse válido, legítimo, porque ninguno de los votantes tenía la información documental que oficialmente se debería haber presentado, distribuido cada uno de los parlamentarios examinada como fundamento de su voto. La propia misteriosa proposición de dos candidaturas por Keiko Fujimori sabemos que apareja ningún documento de los candidatos, pese que la Ley Orgánica del Banco Central de Reserva, en su Artículo 11°, exige como requisitos, de los que aspiren ser miembros del Directorio del Banco, tener “reconocida solvencia moral” una “amplia competencia experiencia en economía finanzas”. Se trata de elementos reales, de hechos que deben probarse con documentos indubitables que el votante tiene que tener ante sí, para analizar, contrastar, evaluar decidir su voto con apego derecho, sin falsear su decisión través del voto informado por intereses vitandos que agreden al país. Reza el violado desacatado, al votar inválidamente, Artículo 11° de la citada Ley Orgánica: “ Los Directores deben ser peruanos, tener reconocida solvencia moral poseer amplia competencia experiencia en economía finanzas. No representan entidad interés particular alguno su voto debe tener en cuenta únicamente el cumplimiento de la finalidad las funciones del Banco”. Si todos los congresistas votantes nunca vieron, dentro del llevado cabo “procedimiento especial parlamentario”, al que hemos antes glosado, ningún documento de los 3 propuestos, 2 por Keiko otro dizque por el APRA, ni hubo debate alguno –el cual se obvió adrede- respecto de sus calidades personales profesionales, el voto que emitieron fue ciego, inducido por el mentado fraude, sin deliberación mental alguna, al carecer de elementos de juicio objetivos reales sobre esa “reconocida solvencia moral”, la necesaria “amplia competencia” además la “amplia experiencia” que deben favorecer cada uno de los propuestos para un voto aprobatorio, válidamente emitido. ¡Si los hechos-requisitos su prueba concomitante están ante sí del congresista votante, su voto resulta viciado, por ende ilegítimo nulo! 3.- Derecho la transparencia de los actos del Estado que garantice el acceso la información pública. Todo indica que nada en este procedimiento parlamentario de elección de estos 3 directores del BCRP fue transparente; todo fue turbio, de principio fin, con un clarísimo fraude procesal iniciado por la demandada Keiko Fujimori. Tanto la repentina proposición fraudulenta hecha por Keiko Fujimori, el día 26-10-2016, un día antes de la elección, sin que se sepa hasta hoy cómo fue, ante una Junta de Portavoces que recibió ni vio los Currículum Vitae de los propuestos; así como la aluvional votación llevada cabo el día siguiente, el jueves 27-10-2016, sin examinar ningún documento acerca de los requisitos que la ley exige los candidatos sin el debate que el Artículo 64° del Reglamento del Congreso requiere para esta elección específica, en un procedimiento parlamentario especial, en relación las calidades personales profesionales, de los 3 futuros miembros del Directorio del Banco Central de Reserva, reviste la obligatoria transparencia que deben adornar los actos del Estado, como éste del Congreso, que prevé regula la Ley 27806, Ley de Transparencia, fin de garantizar el derecho fundamental del acceso la información que consagra el numeral 5 del Artículo 2 de la Constitución Política. Cuando los actos estatales realizados en todo el procedimiento especializado parlamentario en cuestión son transparentes, como en efecto lo han sido, el derecho fundamental la información pública resulta vulnerado, lo cual debe ser reparado. ¿Fue la bravura de una bravísima KEIKO, su audacia un interés nefando que la llevó proponer con fraude miembros del BCRP? ¡Por lo menos, se sabe que fue Keiko Fujimori quien propuso, ¿oralmente por escrito?, su secretario general de su partido político, José Chlimper su ocasional asesor Elmer Cuba, como directores del BCRP, ambos activistas de su campaña electoral presidencial última, ninguno de los 72 congresistas suyos chistó, rechistó, ni hizo amago de mueca alguna, todos doblegaron la cerviz designaron, de un día otro, mediante su voto, los propuestos, sin trámite ni debate alguno, ciegamente, sin examen de requisitos legales sin tener la vista semejantes candidatos, ni siquiera oírlos porque tenían una premura inusitada! ¿Tiene una persona particular, como Keiko Fujimori, lideresa de una agrupación partidaria, el derecho de proponer, con efectos legales e inmediatos, en un procedimiento especial parlamentario, sin ser congresista, directores del citado Banco, nada menos que al Secretario General de su partido Fuerza Popular otro activista de su reciente campaña electoral presidencial? ¿Serán los propuestos, de contundente actuación político partidaria, las personas independientes que contribuyan la autonomía que requiere el BCRP sin poner en riesgo la confidencialidad de una sana política bancaria monetaria en particular? ¡Lo confiesa alegremente que ella fue la que propuso estos 2 candidatos, su atento comedido lugarteniente congresista Miguel Torres Morales, hijo de un antiguo fujimorista, ultramontano, Carlos Torres Torres Lara, ya fallecido; pero que dejó su heredero universal en el Congreso precisamente al lado detrás de Keiko. ¡Su padre estuvo detrás de Alberto, hoy preso! Si esta proposición fraudulenta, silenciosa nada transparente fue suficiente para que 72 votaran por ella, significa que Keiko Fujimori ¡maneja su antojo los 72 congresistas de su partido Fuerza Popular, ora directamente por interpósita persona, como lo hacía antes Vladimiro Montesinos Torres (hoy también preso), en los años 90! Además, la proposición decisión adoptada viola el texto expreso del Artículo 11° de la Ley Orgánica del Banco Central de Reserva del Perú. INCONSTITUCIONAL, ILEGALIDAD, DELITO PRODUCTO ILEGÍTIMO La conducta es la pluralidad de actos realizados que exteriorizan una voluntad; el producto es el resultado conseguido con esa conducta. Los congresistas, mayormente fujimoristas, que designaron José Chlimper, Rafael Rey Elmer Cuba, para integrar el directorio del Banco Central de Reserva del Perú (BCRP), violaron la Constitución Política, las leyes Orgánica de dicho Banco, de Transparencia el Reglamento del Congreso de la República, en la forma antes anotada. Cuando tales parlamentarios producen actos administrativos, como es designar miembros del directorio del BCRP, integrantes de otros organismos, están obligados respetar las normas constitucionales las legales de todo tipo zurrarse en ellas sin incurrir en responsabilidad. Su designio es respetar las normas preexistentes. La Ley Orgánica del Banco Central de Reserva del Perú, en su artículo 11°, obliga que se designe como miembros del directorio del Banco quienes tienen "reconocida solvencia moral" además "amplia competencia experiencia en economía finanzas", requisitos que son hechos macizos, que deben ser reales acreditados con los documentos respectivos. El congresista que vota por alguien propuesto puede crear estos hechos en su cabeza, deducirlos de meros dichos inferirlos por consigna partidaria. Viola la ley si desoye este mandato legal; comete, pues, una ilegalidad, una arbitrariedad. Del mismo modo, todo parlamentario debe "velar por el respeto de la Constitución de las leyes", porque así lo establece el Artículo 102°, inciso 2, de la Constitución Política. Hasta podríamos aseverar que deben dar el ejemplo en acatar la Constitución lo que dispone toda norma legal. Este precepto constitucional fue desacatado por todos aquellos congresistas que designaron con su voto Chlimper, Rey Cuba, como miembros del BCRP, sin que estén acreditadas las situaciones de hecho que la citada Ley Orgánica ha previsto. Violaron, por ende, esa norma constitucional que les obliga respetar las leyes en general la del BCRP en particular. ¡Produjeron una infracción constitucional! Esta acción judicial (proceso de amparo) debe anular el ilegal acto administrativo que surgió sobre la base de dicha ilegalidad e inconstitucionalidad el quehacer delictivo fraudulento antes reseñado hacer efectiva la responsabilidad de los infractores si está cubierta por la inviolabilidad de votos opiniones. El delito de fraude procesal que se ha cometido está previsto en el Artículo 416° del Código Penal, que sanciona el uso de cualquier medio fraudulento para obtener resolución contraria la ley. En efecto, se violó el Artículo 11° de la Ley Orgánica del Banco Central de Reserva, sin que se conozcan si los propuestos por Keiko reunían los requisitos exigidos.
